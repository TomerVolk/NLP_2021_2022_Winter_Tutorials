Speaking at the Agriculture Department to representatives of the U.S. National Cattlemen's Association, Lyng said some dairymen asked the program be extended. But he said the Reagan administration, which opposed the whole herd buyout program in the 1985 farm bill, would not agree to an extension. The program begun in early 1986, is to be completed this summer. U.S. cattlemen bitterly opposed the scheme, complaining that increased dairy cow slaughter drove cattle prices down last year.

PUBLISHED-TESTSET,['trade'],"The European Community responded to widespread U.S. criticism of its trade policies by publishing an extensive list of U.S. actions which pose obstacles to EC exports. A spokeswoman for the EC Commission said the detailed 25-page report of alleged malpractices was in response to a similar document issued by U.S. Administration officials in November, and updated a previous EC list. EC External Trade Relations Commissioner Willy De Clercq said its object was to show such actions were not solely taken by trading partners of the U.S. And that ""the U.S. Were not innocents in the matter."" The report covers the entire field of EC-U.S. Commercial relations and lists more than 30 obstacles ranging from tariff measures, import quotas, customs duties, anti-dumping procedures, fiscal barriers and export subsidies. The Commission said not all the barriers mentioned were necessarily inconsistent with U.S. International obligations, and emphasised many of them could be removed at upcoming international trade talks. ""The purpose of the report is to make clear that trade practices which impede exports are not a unique problem only faced by U.S. Exporters. Europeans face similar problems in the U.S.,"" it said. Among the obstacles detailed in the report are import restrictions on food products, such as cheese, sugar and syrup, certain wines, beers and juices, as well as on firearms and machine tools. It also criticises programs to boost U.S. Cereals exports. The document said the U.S.'s three-year export enhancement program (EEP), which began in 1985, had subsidised exports of 9.7 mln tonnes of wheat, two mln tonnes of wheat flour and 2.8 mln tonnes of barley up to mid-March this year. The subsidies granted so far were worth about 620 mln dlrs, it added. ""The Community has already reacted where necessary to U.S. EEP subsidies by increasing its exports refunds, and will continue to do so,"" it said, adding the current GATT round would also provide an opportunity to address the subject. The document also says import quotas maintained by the U.S. On a range of farm products, including sugar, peanuts and certain cottons, restrict EC exports. In addition, the report deplores a recent U.S.-Japan accord on semi-conductors, export controls on technology transfers, standards tests in the telecommunications arena and the U.S. Administration's ""buy American"" public procurement policy.

PUBLISHED-TESTSET,"['livestock', 'carcass', 'trade']","U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng warned Japan that the failure to remove a longstanding import quota on Japanese beef might spark a protectionist response in the United States. ""Given the protectionist mood in the Congress and the country, if I were a leader in Japan I would certainly be very concerned...and the failure to remove it (the beef quota) might be very serious,"" Lyng told a group of U.S cattlemen. Lyng said he and Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter, during a visit to Japan later this month, will demand ""total elimination"" of the beef import quota by April 1988. The current dispute with Japan over semiconductor may strengthen the U.S. stance in farm trade negotiations, Lyng said, because Japan does not want a trade war with the U.S. Lyng dismissed recent statements in Tokyo that Japan might retaliate against U.S. products as a result of the semiconductor dispute. ""They (Japan) aren't going to pick a fight with us,"" Lyng said, adding that with its huge bilateral trade surplus Japan has more to lose in a trade war than the United States.

PUBLISHED-TESTSET,['silver'],"Heightened concern over renewed inflation is feeding the rally in silver and the upward move could drive the inflation hedge metal this year to as much as 9.00 dlrs per troy ounce, Mike Boswell chairman of Sunshine Mining Co told Reuters in an interview. ""The anticipated higher inflation is being manifested in silver rather than in gold which is the traditional choice of inflation hedgers,"" said Boswell. The strength could put silver in a range of ""8.00 to 9.00 dlrs even without any material swings in supply/demand,"" Boswell said. The buying interest for silver on the New York Commodity Exchange (Comex) continued strong, with prices rising today to a September 1986 high of 6.465 dlrs per ounce. However gold lagged at 426.30 dlrs, the strongest price since late January this year. Boswell said silver has been ""under-valued for so long relative to gold but it's closing up the price gap."" He noted that silver last year held at the depressed level of 5.00 dlrs while gold was soaring to more than 400.00 dlrs on concern over the heated political unrest in South Africa. ""The strength was not filtering down to silver last year. Now we're seeing a delayed reaction,"" the Sunshine Mining official said. Almost a year ago, U.S. producers shut down two of their largest silver properties, Sunshine and Hecla mining companies, both located in Idaho. Boswell estimated that the closings slashed U.S. silver production by 10 mln ounces last year to less than 40 mln ounces. ""Low silver prices and high labor costs made it uneconomical to keep the mines opened,"" he said. Increased imports from Mexico and Peru have made up for the loss of production in the United States which consumes 160 to 170 mln ounces annually, Boswell said. Reuter &#3;"

PUBLISHED-TESTSET,"['interest', 'money-fx']","Belgian Finance Minister Mark Eyskens warmly welcomed this week's increase in U.S. Prime rates, calling it a move that went beyond the Group of Five and Canada Paris accord on stabilising currencies. The rate rise would underpin economic and financial policy convergence among major countries, he added. In an interview with Reuters, Eyskens also made clear he believed the countries involved in the accord - the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Britain and Canada - had agreed ""tentative"" fluctuation ranges for exchange rates. Eyskens was speaking before hosting an informal meeting of European Community finance ministers and central bank chiefs in Belgium this weekend focusing on the international monetary situation and proposals for strengthening the European Monetary System (EMS). Asked about the dollar's recent fall on currency markets, Eyskens said he believed the Paris agreement was proving ""more or less workable"" despite what he called evident disagreements over U.S. Economic and monetary policy between Treasury Secretary James Baker and Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker. Besides Baker's public statements that had dramatically influenced exchange markets, trade tensions between the U.S.And Japan had also caused the dollar's fall, expecially against the yen, he said. But he expressed optimism that Washington and Tokyo could reach a compromise in their row over semi-conductor trade. ""I think agreement is quite possible,"" he said. Eyskens said he was ""very agreeably surprised"" by this week's quarter-point increase in U.S. Prime rates despite the obvious negative consequences for debtor countries. ""It is a positive element which goes further than the (Paris) Louvre agreement ...It is the market taking account of its content,"" he said. He added that coordination of interest rates was a fundamental element of economic and monetary convergence between leading industrialised economies. ""A policy of maintaining exchange rates within fluctuation ranges is not possible if it is not accompanied at least by a more coordinated policy of interest rates,"" he said. Eyskens made clear he believed the G-6 countries had agreed in Paris on ranges in which to hold their currencies. He said the end of the February 22 Louvre accord, in which the partners agreed to cooperate closely to foster exchange rate stability around current levels, clearly alluded to a ""system of tentative (fluctuation) margins."" He added the meeting and the statement would have been meaningless if the G-6 had not discussed the technicalities of implementing it. Eyskens said there was growing economic convergence among leading industrialised countries pointing towards greater order in the international monetary system. ""That doesn't mean we are ready to restore Bretton Woods (the post-World War Two system of fixed exchange rates), but within the (International Monetary Fund) Interim Committee we are thinking in terms of target zones, fluctuation ranges to be implemented and defended,"" he said. The Interim Committee meets next week in Washington ahead of the IMF's Spring meetings, and Eyskens said the EC ministers would prepare for the gatherings at this weekend's talks. He said he hoped for wide-ranging talks on the future of the EMS at the weekend meeting, based on proposals from the EC's Monetary Committee and Committee of Central Bank Governors for strengthening the system through technical and institutional changes. Eyskens said he expected EC Commission President Jacques Delors to submit proposals for fully liberalising capital movements within the 12-nation bloc and made clear he shared Delors' view that this must be accompanied by a reinforcement of the EMS. ""Both are totally linked. Liberalisation without strengthening the EMS would destabilise the Community,"" he said. REUTER &#3;"

PUBLISHED-TESTSET,"['interest', 'money-fx']","Belgian Finance Minister Mark Eyskens warmly welcomed this week's increase in U.S. Prime rates, calling it a move that went beyond the Group of Five and Canada Paris accord on stabilising currencies. The rate rise would underpin economic and financial policy convergence among major countries, he added. In an interview with Reuters, Eyskens also made clear he believed the countries involved in the accord -- the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Britain and Canada -- had agreed ""tentative"" fluctuation ranges for exchange rates. Eyskens was speaking before hosting an informal meeting of European Community finance ministers and central bank chiefs in Belgium this weekend focusing on the international monetary situation and proposals for strengthening the European Monetary System (EMS). Asked about the dollar's recent fall on currency markets, Eyskens said he believed the Paris agreement was proving ""more or less workable"" despite what he called evident disagreements over U.S. Economic and monetary policy between Treasury Secretary James Baker and Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker. Besides Baker's public statements that had dramatically influenced exchange markets, trade tensions between the U.S.And Japan had also caused the dollar's fall, expecially against the yen, he said. But he expressed optimism that Washington and Tokyo could reach a compromise in their row over semi-conductor trade. ""I think agreement is quite possible,"" he said. Eyskens said he was ""very agreeably surprised"" by this week's quarter-point increase in U.S. Prime rates despite the obvious negative consequences for debtor countries. ""It is a positive element which goes further than the (Paris) Louvre agreement ...It is the market taking account of its content,"" he said. He added that coordination of interest rates was a fundamental element of economic and monetary convergence between leading industrialised economies. ""A policy of maintaining exchange rates within fluctuation ranges is not possible if it is not accompanied at least by a more coordinated policy of interest rates,"" he said. Reuter &#3;"
PUBLISHED-TESTSET,['money-fx'],"The Nigerian naira firmed  against the dollar, banking sources said, after the rules governing foreign exchange auctions at the central bank were changed. The marginal rate set at today's auction, from which reporters were barred for the first time since the sessions began last September, was 3.7001 to the dollar compared with 4.0002 at the last session on March 19, the sources said. Under the new system unveiled on March 20 and in operation for the first time today, bidding banks must pay for foreign exchange at the rate they bid, rather than as previously at the rate of the lowest successful bid. The measure was aimed at discouraging banks from bidding high and thus driving down the naira's value. But banking sources and other analysts said demand for foreign exchange remained sharply higher than the available funds. Henceforth the sessions will be held every fortnight, instead of weekly, and today only 80 mln dlrs was on offer compared with the 50 mln dlrs usually on sale each week. The rule change appeared to have an immediate impact on bids. Today's highest bid was 4.06 to the dollar, compared with a top bid of 4.25 two weeks ago. Banks who bid higher than the marginal rate will be able to pass on their rate to their customers, while the marginal rate will only act as a marker for transactions. REUTER &#3;"
PUBLISHED-TESTSET,['coffee'],"Coffee prices look set to continue sliding in the near term, given the lack of progress towards a new International Coffee Organization (ICO) export quota accord, according to coffee traders and analysts. Robusta coffee futures dipped sharply to 4-1/2 year lows yesterday at 1,220 stg per tonne, basis the May position, when the lack of new debate on quotas at ICO talks here confirmed expectations that efforts to restore quotas would not be revived at this stage, they said. The 15-day ICO average composite price fell to 99.69 cents a lb for April 1, the lowest for 5-1/2 years. Quotas will not now be renegotiated before the ICO's annual September council session, and in the interim the Brazilian frost season from June to August may prove the only bullish factor to stem further price weakness, they said. Futures bounced back from the lows today towards the previous trading range around 1,260/1,270 stg per tonne on May as the market recovered from yesterday's ""confidence blip,"" one trader commented. But despite today's upturn, the overall trend is for lower prices in the near future, one trade source said. The market had become increasingly vulnerable to yesterday's shakeout, having held within a 1,250/1,350 stg second position trading range for 22 successive sessions, he said. Technically the market is more likely to decline further as it absorbs today's brief rally. Steep declines towards the 1,100/1,050 stg area could foster a ""three figure mentality,"" and speculators may elect to push for coffee prices below the psychological 1,000 stg level, he added. Some traders said today's upturn was in part due to Brazil's opening last night of May green coffee export registrations. This had been widely anticipated by the market and came as no surprise, but it did remove some prevailing uncertainty and light trade buying was seen this morning as a consequence. However, the overall trend remains downwards and a test of support at 1,200 stg should be expected soon, with the only possible supportive influence on the horizon being the approach of Brazil's frost season, they said. Roasters are believed to be well covered, limiting activities to modest hand-to-mouth purchases and generally not taking up producer offers, they added. Central American producers have sold the bulk of their current crops, but robusta producers in West Africa and Indonesia need to sell coffee for April through July shipment, and this could pressure prices further, traders said. However, one dealer, although seeing no reason to be bullish, advised caution. ""Everybody's bearish now, just as they were bullish when the market was at 3,100 stg,"" he said. Arthur Cherry, coffee analyst at E.D. and F. Man, expressed doubts the price spiral would continue much below current levels. ""One dlr coffee is catastrophic for many producers -- there must be a minimum below which prices cannot fall."" While prices dropped to the lowest levels since September 1982 yesterday, manufacturers have no plans to cut their retail prices. ""Its impossible to say, we can't predict anything like that at this stage,"" a General Foods spokesman said. Manufacturers have lowered prices recently anyway in response to market weakness. At the beginning of March the price of a 100 gram jar of coffee was cut to 1.55 stg from 1.65 stg in Britain. But should coffee market prices continue to fall, the situation would be reviewed, the spokesman added. Nestle also has no plans to make additional price cuts in the near future. ""The market seems to have established some equilibrium and doesn't look set to go much lower,"" a Nestle spokesman commented. Coffee's plunge this week has been mirrored by tea, which fell to a 5-1/2 year low at today's auction at 1.18 stg per kilo for medium quality, traders added. Reuter &#3;"

PUBLISHED-TESTSET,"['stg', 'money-fx']","Sterling made a sharp recovery when U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson described remarks he made yesterday on targets for the pound as ""insignificant,"" rallying back up almost exactly to the levels it had fetched before Lawson spoke yesterday, dealers and analysts said. They said sterling would likely leave the limelight once again to trade quietly around current levels, as the markets set their sights on the dollar, yen and mark again ahead of key international monetary talks in Washington next week. Sterling ended its European day at 1.6020/30 dlrs, virtually unchanged from yesterday's last 1.6040/50 dlrs, fetched before Lawson's first comment. But it was well up on levels just above 1.59 dlrs which it had held until the second comment came. Against the mark, sterling recovered to close at 2.9190/9240 marks after today's opening 2.9040/90 and last night's 2.9210/45. ""On balance, it is as if nothing happened ... We are back to where we were before,"" Mark Brett, economist at securities house Barclays de Zoete Wedd said. ""This whole story is like a storm in a teacup,"" a dealer with a U.K. Bank commented. The pound's recovery was triggered when Lawson criticised media coverage of comments he made yesterday, when he told a conference he wanted sterling to stay roughly where it was. In this context, Lawson was reported to have specified rates of around 2.90 marks and 1.60 dlrs to the pound in remarks which markets were quick to interpret as a signal to sell sterling. Lawson said today he had merely stated yesterday's approximate value of the pound. ""The wrong end of the stick was picked up,"" he told reporters, adding his comments did in no way signal a change in British exchange rate policies. Dealers and analysts said the reactions to both statements were clear evidence that the market, frustrated by the relative currency stability after the February 22 Paris agreement, was desperate to reactivate trading and would react to any clues offered about the contents of the currency accord. In Paris, finance ministers of the Group of Five and Canada are widely believed to have agreed exchange rate targets, although no participant has specified these in an apparent bid to foster stability by keeping markets guessing. ""The markets are absolutely desperate to get clues on Group of Six (countries that are part to the Paris agreement) targets ... The number of rumours flying around is bigger than ever before,"" said Barclays de Zoete Wedd's Brett. Analysts said neither yesterday's remarks nor today's had changed their impression that after Paris, sterling was targeted to trade in broad ranges against major currencies. All polled analysts said if anything, the 2.90 marks level mentioned by Lawson was probably the centre of a wide 20-pfennig range which sterling would easily hold, helped by good economic indicators and relatively high interest rates. ""It would be insane to pinpoint an exchange rate ahead of an election ... I don't believe Lawson is mad enough to tie himself to a fixed rate,"" Brett said. He expected sterling to firm over the next few weeks, to around 2.95 marks and 1.63 dlrs, as overseas investors reappraised high-yielding investments here. Robin Marshall, chief economist at Chase Manhattan Securities, said he was not surprised to see Lawson qualify his sterling target comments so quickly. ""His remarks gave markets a target to aim at,"" he said, adding, ""He (Lawson) talked himself into a bit of a corner on this ... It made him a hostage to fortune."" Marshall and other analysts dismissed a theory, that by quoting target rates Lawson had attempted to put pressure on prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to agree to British membership of the European Monetary System (EMS), as implausible.

PUBLISHED-TESTSET,['crude'],"Amoco Corp first quarter profits are expected to exceed the 165 mln dlrs, or 65 cts per share, reported for 1986's fourth quarter, chairman Richard Morrow said. Speaking to reporters after a security analyst meeting, he said the gain was expected because of higher oil and gas prices, but declined to compare his expectations with the 331 mln dlrs, or 1.28 dlrs per share, the company earned in 1986's first quarter. Earlier, Morrow told the analysts that Amoco's first quarter refining and marketing results ""will look pretty poor,"" because of low margins in January and February. The margins began to improve last month and look pretty good now, he added. Morrow said he expects oil product margins to remain good for the rest of the year, ""but it remains to be seen if they will match 1986 levels."" The Amoco chairman said he expects crude oil prices to remain in the 17 to 20 dlr barrel range for the rest of 1988 based on his belief that OPEC's agreement will hold. Morrow said his best estimate for 1989 crude oil prices is 21 dlrs per barrel, adding he believes this price level would result in a 40 pct increase in oil company exploration spending. President H. Lawrance Fuller told the analysts Amoco reduced its estimates of worldwide oil and gas reserves by a total of 201 mln equivalent barrels last year because of a drop in oil and gas prices. Noting the Securities and Exchange Commission requires that reserves be estimated on the assumption that year-end prices will remain fixed for the life of the properties, he said the drop in oil prices to 16 dlrs a barrel at the end of 1986 from 27 dlrs a year earlier forced the company to reduce its reserve estimate by four pct. Fuller said Amoco expects its U.S. oil and natural gas liquids production to decline about five pct this year from last year's 121 mln barrels because of drilling deferrals made last year when oil prices were falling. He said the full impact of the deferrals was off-set by the purchase of properties which will add about 5,000 barrels per day to the company's 1987 U.S. production. Fuller said U.S. refining capacity is expected to be increasingly strained by the rising demand for lead-free gasoline, especially the higher octane grades.

""I don't see a substantial rise in rates this year.

""I would suspect General Foods will make a name for themselves with their gourmet line,"" said a coffee trade source. ""What it could do is really dent the small-store, whole-bean business,"" the trade source added. The new lines are designed to appeal to a classic advertising composite--the ""yuppie"" consumer. They buy fresh pasta, subscribe to Bon Appetit magazine and were ""first on their block with a wok,"" as described by Karin Brown, General Foods senior product manager for its new coffee, called Private Collection out of GF's Maxwell House division. Paul Gallant, president of A and P's Compass Foods subsidiary that makes the new A and P gourmet line, described its potential appeal as ""a status thing."" At an initial price of 4.99 dlrs for 12 ounces it is expensive, though not more so than high quality coffee sold in small specialty stores. General Foods' Maxwell House Div. has just cut the price on its new offering by 50 cents to 4.49 dlrs for 12 ounces--a move competitor A and P is bound to imitate, according to an A and P executive. Number two U.S. roaster Folgers has ""nothing to announce at this point"" in the gourmet line, a spokesman said. Neither does Hills Bros., a subsidiary of Nestle that shares the third and fourth size market spot by volume with A and P. Competitors believe Folgers will watch the progress of General Foods' offering, prepared to jump in if the market takes off. General Foods and A and P hope their new products will help push coffee sales out of the doldrums. Coffee consumption in the United States has fallen 44 pct since 1962, according to a 1986 study by the International Coffee Organization. Sales show no signs of picking up. Compass's Gallant blames the falloff on declines in coffee quality since the 1960's and aggressive soft drink marketing. ""The national brands began to cheapen the blend in the name of profit but spent 100 mln dlrs a year telling consumers this was quality coffee,"" Gallant said. As a result, first time consumers never got a taste for the brew. The first time a young consumer tries coffee, ""they turn around and say 'My God this is awful, I think I'll have a Coke',"" he said. Having now mostly written off the 16-25 age group, who have confirmed their loyalty to soft drinks, coffee marketers are aiming at the high income, free-spending, self-treating crowd -- the yuppie composite. ""Where else are you going to go?,"" an industry source said. ""Kids aren't going to drink coffee, that's apparent. There are no other markets. The only area that's not been promoted is gourmet,"" he said. In addition to perking up sales, success in the gourmet line could provide much higher margins to roasters than regular ground roast coffees produce. Generally, retail prices are about twice the price of green, unroasted coffee beans, taking into account the costs of roasting, packaging and distribution, and then deducting often-generous trade discounts. Supermarkets tend to sell coffee near the trade price as a ""loss leader,"" a product designed to draw shoppers into the store. But with the new gourmet lines, a different pricing structure prevails, industry sources said. There is no trade discounting and an emphasis on expensive packaging, including a special valve designed to keep the beans fresher. Dealers said roasters were buying the higher quality green beans at about 1.60 dlrs a lb. Thus, retail prices on gourmet coffee are now almost three times the price of green. Targetted consumers seem willing to pay the difference. General Foods claims 80 pct of consumers in their test market surveys for Private Collection came back for more. And product manager Brown points to the success of more expensive beers, mustard and ice cream, that began selling in restricted high income areas and are now available in almost every supermarket in the country. A and P is similarly optimistic. ""We think we'll do extremely well in the gourmet market,"" Gallant said. Maxwell House is marketing its eight types of Private Collection in selected high income areas, while A and P offers its 14 different whole bean gourmet coffees, called 8 O'Clock Royale, only in their own stores in Philadelphia, Baltimore, New York, Atlanta and some other metropolitan areas.

PUBLISHED-TESTSET,"['grain', 'wheat', 'corn', 'oilseed', 'soybean']","Sharp cuts this year in U.S. planted acreage may not make a big dent in the U.S. grain stockpile but will at least keep grain surpluses from increasing, Agriculture Department and industry commodity analysts said. ""The scenario is turning around on stocks. The whole supply/demand picture could finally be getting more in balance,"" a USDA analyst said. The USDA prospective plantings report this week indicated that U.S. farmers will idle 52 to 55 mln acres in annual acreage reduction programs this year. An additional 20 mln acres have been enrolled in the conservation reserve program, bringing total idled acreage in the U.S. to 72-75 mln acres, almost a third of the nation's total 235 mln acre crop base. Production of wheat, corn and soybeans in 1986/87 will probably closely match annual usage, limiting any buildup in stocks, analysts said. ""It's a substantially different story from last year when we added 1.5 billion bushels of corn to the stockpile,"" Vernon McMinimy, director of commodity research for Staley Co. said. Interviewed at an agribusiness education conference here, McMinimy said that 67.6 mln planted acres of corn will likely translate into 60 mln harvested acres, and with normal yields, final production of 6.9 to 7.0 billion bushels. McMinimy estimated that total U.S. corn disappearance in 1986/87 could end up at 7.1 billion bushels, possibly resulting in a 200-million bushel reduction in the current corn stockpile of 5.45 billion bushels. ""To say this represents a turn-around is wrong, but we're at least in a holding pattern,"" George Hoffman, director of commodity analysis for Pillsbury said. Hoffman said wheat stocks could rise slightly by the end of 1986/87 to 1.9 billion bushels due to ""significantly less"" domestic feed use for wheat because of lower corn prices. USDA analysts, however, project slightly higher usage and said wheat stocks will either decrease slightly or at least not increase. With yearly use at around two billion bushels, next year's projected crop could be used up, an analyst said. ""We won't be adding to stocks. Stocks are at a record now, so if we can begin to touch them even minutely through acreage reductions, that would be an improvement,"" an Agriculture Department wheat analyst said. Soybean planted acreage, at 56.9 mln acres, would be the smallest planted soybean acreage since 1976 and could lower final production by 150 mln bushels and ending stocks by 50 to 100 mln bushels, analysts said. As more marginal, erodable acreage is enrolled in the conservation reserve program, annual acreage reduction programs will be more effective because they will force more high producing land out of production, a USDA analyst said. ""We can now maybe see the light at the end of a very long tunnel,"" the analyst said. Reuter &#3;"

In a televised address tonight, he criticised the World Bank for making Peru make larger debt payments than the amount the bank is willing to make in new loans. ""We will deepen our policy on the foreign debt,"" he said. Peru has limited foreign debt repayments to 10 pct of export earnings, effectively suspending most remittances due foreign private banks and many governments. It has generally been current for most of Garcia's 20 months in office on payments to the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank. But tonight Garcia said: ""We have met our aim of limiting the payment of the debt and will limit it also even though organisations like the World Bank have credits which oblige us to buy a certain type of machinery and to build certain types of public works and not others, and to pay much more in dollars than that which they are willing to newly lend us."" The Economy Ministry said last year it owed the World Bank about 520 mln dlrs in loans out of the country's 14 billion dlr debt. Garcia said his government had been a model for Latin America because Peru had enjoyed growth in gross domestic product (GDP) last year of nine pct while taking its hard line on debt. He said GDP would grow by at least six pct this year. He announced an immediate 40 pct rise in the minimum wage to 1,260 intis per month, benefiting the 1.3 mln minimum-wage workers out of a total labour force of 6.7 mln. Salaries will go up this month by 30 pct for civil servants and 27 pct for those workers earning above the minimum wage but not covered by collective bargaining agreements. He also said the price of petrol, frozen since August 1, 1985, would increase by 20 pct from the current 17.5 intis per U.S. Gallon and remain at the new level for the rest of the year.

It was the second production sharing contract signed by Pertamina this year. Three contracts were awarded in 1986. The agreement, signed at a public ceremony in the presence of Energy Minister Subroto, calls for the standard oil production split of 85-15 pct in Pertamina's favour. Hong Kong-based Enim Oil is contracted to spend 120 mln dlrs over the next six years, including 10 mln in the first two years. The 1,137 sq km Lematang block is located between two oil producing sectors of South Sumatra, and Enim officials said there is a good chance of getting a high return on investment. A spokesman said the area, which has not been drilled before, was neglected because it is deeper than surrounding blocks. He said new developments in seismic techniques have now made seismic survey possible. The agreement is similar to a production-sharing contract Pertamina signed with Occidental Petroleum Corp in February. Gas produced will be divided 70-30 pct in Pertamina's favour with operational costs deducted. Pertamina can market at least 50 pct of Enim Oil's production share, and Enim must give up 10 pct of its interest in the block to an appointed Indonesian company if it finds oil. Enim must also set aside 28.57 pct of its crude for refining in Indonesia if its share exceeds 150,000 barrels a day. REUTER &#3;"
PUBLISHED-TESTSET,['crude'],"Japanese oil traders generally expect oil prices to remain steady through June, when the next Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' (Opec) meeting is scheduled to take place. Prices have kept to a narrow trading range for more than a month, despite coming under considerable pressure in February as Japanese oil companies holding high oil stocks strongly resist paying official prices, trade sources said. Despite these attempts, spot crude rose steadily to stabilize around OPEC's 18 dlr a barrel target, they said. Spot prices fell more than two dlrs during the month, mainly on market assumptions Opec was producing more than its 15.8 mln barrel a day (bpd) self-imposed ceiling and members would submit to pressure to discount prices, oil traders said. However, Opec's discipline in holding its price and output targets eventually forced many of the buyers back, they said. Countries such as Qatar, Iran and Iraq refused to bend to demands for lower prices in spite of threats of non-lifting from Japanese buyers. The solidarity of Opec encouraged Qatar to charter vessels to store its production rather than cut its prices, they said. Opec's March production was 14.6 mln bpd, 1.2 mln below its ceiling, with Saudi Arabia's output just below 3.0 mln bpd compared to its Opec quota of 4.133 mln bpd, the Middle East Economic Survey estimated. ""Of course there was a little cheating but not enough to destroy the market,"" an oil trader in Tokyo said. Opec crudes have been appearing on the spot market at discounted prices through barter deals and the swapping of Middle East grades for North Sea cargoes, but these trades have not generated sufficient volume to depress the market, he said. The current spot values of Middle East grades are only 20 to 25 cts below official prices, so resistance to buying crude under term contracts in the second quarter is likely to be weaker, traders said. Indonesia's Minister of Energy and Mines Subroto said today OPEC faces the choice of either maintaining present output volume at 15.8 mln bpd and seeing prices increase slightly, or raising the production ceiling so members can produce more in the third and fourth quarters of 1987.

In a press conference after talks with South Korean leaders, Baldrige called the government's announced intention to regulate exports and boost imports ""a very, very important step, the right direction for the Korean government to take."" The government adopted the new policies last week in the hope of heading off a trade war with the U.S. Baldrige said the policies ""showed an understanding of the fact that this country cannot go on indefinitely growing by exports alone."" ""There has to be enough of a change so that domestic growth begins to take more of the load,"" he said. South Korea had a 7.2 billion dlr trade surplus with Washington in 1986, thanks largely to booming sales of cars and consumer electronic goods. It racked up another 1.4 billion dlrs in surplus in the first quarter of this year. Baldrige said Seoul's package of measures was ""broad enough and comprehensive enough so that ... Actions can be taken for liberalising imports (and) increasing the domestic economy, if the government is willing to follow through."" ""We will be watching the implementation of this new policy direction very closely,"" he said. ""Because of the protectionism growing in the U.S., We see a real problem if Korea does not keep on the same path ... Of steadily increasing liberalisation....

These included service industries, which he said were still too much of a closed sector in South Korea, and computers and cars. Baldrige said he urged speedy action on removing the tariffs and taxes on imported U.S. Cars which can make them sell for up to three times their American prices. ""We want to stop that. With this sort of thing, there's going to be trouble somewhere down the road,"" he said. ""We are just pointing this out."" Asked if Seoul's measures could succeed without a revaluation of the won, which Washington has been urging for months, Baldrige declined to comment. ""We don't have any target for any particular currency, but we do feel that currencies around the world, if we are going to be successful as a world economy, have to reflect the fundamentals of the various economies involved,"" he said.

A confidential ""executive summary"" of a draft Bank report on the Indian economy was made available to Reuters. It suggests liberalisation as part of a package of reforms to boost exports of Indian goods by making them more competitive. The summary said, ""These reforms would result in (domestic) prices much more in line with world prices than is true today, and in a greater degree of import competition and export rivalry than the nation has ever seen."" The summary said foreign trade must play a key role in India's transition towards a more dynamic economy. Liberal imports of capital goods would help modernise the economy and expose Indian producers to foreign competition. Larger exports would provide the foreign exchange for imports. ""The main guideline is unambiguously to abandon the present principle of unlimited protection for all indigenously available products and to recognise the role of actual or potential competition from imports as a source of discipline on the prices and costs of public and private sector domestic manufacturers,"" the summary said. An Indian official told Reuters the government was discussing the report with the Bank. A final report with some changes was likely to be ready by May, but he declined to give further details. The Bank and industrialised nations will discuss the Bank's final report at a meeting in Paris on June 22 and 23 to discuss aid for India in the 1987/88 year starting in June. The summary said India's gross domestic product (gdp) grew at an average five pct in Indian fiscal years 1985/86 and 1986/87, which ended in March. It said investment was being sustained at nearly 25 pct of gdp. Almost 94 pct of the investment was being financed by national savings, mainly from the private sector. India's trade deficit is officially said to have narrowed to 5.6 billion dlrs in 1986/87 ended March, from a record 6.96 billion dlrs in 1985/86. The current account deficit fell to 2.4 billion dlrs in 1986/87 from 2.88 billion in 1985/86. But the summary said the improvement was largely due to lower prices of crude oil, petroleum products and fertilisers which make up the bulk of India's import bill. India was able to save about 2.6 billion dlrs in foreign exchange in 1986/87 due to lower prices of those products, the summary said. The Bank's summary said there was little room for complacency in the balance of payments position. It said that despite a lower trade deficit in 1986/87, Indian foreign exchange reserves fell by 240 mln dlrs. Real export growth would need to average at least 6.1 pct a year in value terms in the coming years to maintain a viable balance of payments, the summary said. It did not explicitly suggest the rupee should be devalued. India ""might have to reaffirm the commitment to exporting while undertaking some dramatic changes in general incentives that involve some political costs,"" it said. ""An example of such a policy would be the adoption of an exchange rate regime that maintained exporters' profitability,"" the summary said.

The government adopted the new policies last week in the hope of heading off a trade war with the U.S. Baldrige said the policies ""showed an understanding of the fact that this country cannot go on indefinitely growing by exports alone."" ""There has to be enough of a change so that domestic growth begins to take more of the load,"" he said. South Korea had a 7.2 billion dlr trade surplus with Washington in 1986, thanks largely to booming sales of cars and consumer electronic goods. It racked up another 1.4 billion dlrs in surplus in the first quarter of this year. Baldrige said Seoul's package of measures was ""broad enough and comprehensive enough so that ... Actions can be taken for liberalising imports (and) increasing the domestic economy, if the government is willing to follow through."" ""We will be watching the implementation of this new policy direction very closely,"" he said. ""Because of the protectionism growing in the U.S., We see a real problem if Korea does not keep on the same path ... Of steadily increasing liberalisation.... If that should falter or fail or turn backward, I'm as sure as I'm standing here that we'd see protectionist movement in the U.S."" Baldrige said he and South Korean Trade Minister Rha Woong-bae spent much time discussing trade problems in specific product categories. These included service industries, which he said were still too much of a closed sector in South Korea, and computers and cars. Baldrige said he urged speedy action on removing the tariffs and taxes on imported U.S. Cars which can make them sell for up to three times their American prices. ""We want to stop that. With this sort of thing, there's going to be trouble somewhere down the road,"" he said. ""We are just pointing this out."" Asked if Seoul's measures could succeed without a revaluation of the won, which Washington has been urging for months, Baldrige declined to comment. ""We don't have any target for any particular currency, but we do feel that currencies around the world, if we are going to be successful as a world economy, have to reflect the fundamentals of the various economies involved,"" he said. Baldrige said he had agreed to Rha's proposal for cooperation on forming U.S.-South Korean joint ventures in third countries. The American government would be pleased to encourage U.S. Firms to get involved, he added. Commenting on President Reagan's decision to increase tariffs on certain Japanese imports to the U.S., Baldrige said Washington's trade problems with Japan were not comparable to its difficulties with South Korea. ""I think the attitude in Korea is both reasonable and fair,"" he said. ""It's a firm attitude. We don't get anything for nothing or just by asking for it. ""But our negotiations are friendly and reasonable and they usually end up with something good happening at the end that both countries live up to."" REUTER &#3;"

Howe said in an address to the annual meeting of the U.N. Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) that success in fighting protectionism hinges on the current Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. He said Britain is committed to resisting and combatting protectionism because free trade is vital to Britain where 30 pct of the gnp comes from trade in goods and services. Howe urged developing countries to open up their markets, remove measures distorting free trade in services and provide protection for intellectual property rights. He said industrial nations should also adopt macro-economic policies which help reduce trade imbalances and promote stable currency relationships. Howe said the agricultural industry, plagued by surpluses and falling commodity prices in recent years, is over subsidised and over protected. But the problem of farm surpluses must be tackled despite the fact that it is politically difficult for any government to reverse the trend of growing farm subsidies. ""This problem of over-subsidisation and over-protection of agriculture will dog us in the years ahead and it will need the sustained application of all our energy and our imagination to find solutions,"" Howe said.

It will be discussed soon by officials of the Finance Ministry, the Central Bank and the Council for Economic Planning and Development before being submitted to the cabinet for final approval, he said. ""This is the first ambitious proposal with government initiatives to encourage our businessmen to invest in America,"" Lee said. He said government incentives to prospective Taiwanese investors would include bank loans and a five-year income tax holiday. Applications for investing in the U.S. Would also be simplified. A ministry spokesman told reporters the proposed investment would be helpful in creating job opportunities for Americans and avoiding U.S. Import quotas or restrictions on Taiwanese products. The plan will also help reduce Taiwan's trade surplus with the U.S., Which rose to a record 13.6 billion U.S. Dlrs in 1986, up from 10.2 billion in 1985, the spokesman said.

The case involved a hostile takeover bid by Dynamics Corp of America against CTS Corp, based in Elkhart, Ind. Dynamics made a tender offer in 1985 for one million shares to bring its holdings of CTS stock to 27.5 pct of the company's total.  After CTS invoked the state law, Dynamics filed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the measure. One effect of the law is to impose a 50-day delay on the tender offer at the option of the target company. It also requires that the acquisition for control shares in an Indiana corporation does not include voting rights unless a majority of all pre-existing shareholders so agree at their next regularly scheduled meeting.

Falconbridge records its cash and accounts receivable in U.S. dollars, with the Canadian dollar equivalent decreasing as the U.S. dollar falls. He said the first quarter loss also stemmed from weaker nickel and ferronickel prices and lower production at the company's Sudbury, Ontario nickel operations and at some Kidd Creek operations. Falconbridge anticipates higher production through the rest of the year and higher average prices this year for precious metals, James added, without elaborating. Falconbridge has no immediate plans for further divestments, James said in reply to reporters' inquiries. The company sold several mining subsidiaries last year to help pay down debt from its January, 1986 acquisition of Kidd Creek Mines Ltd from Canada Development Corp &lt;CDC.TO>. He said Falconbridge's debt now totaled about one billion dlrs, down from 1.37 billion dlrs at the time of the Kidd Creek buy. James said he could not assess the impact of Amoco Corp &lt;AN>'s proposed acquisition of Dome Petroleum Ltd &lt;DMP>. Dome's 23 pct-owned Dome Mines Ltd &lt;DM> owns 21 pct of Falconbridge.

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Quantum, which already holds 1,647,481 Fairchild common shares, or 11.5 pct of the total outstanding, said it agreed to the restriction after Fairchild said its security clearance might be jeopardized if Quantum acquires a major stake in it. But Quantum said Fairchild management was told that Soros, acting either individually or through entities other than Quantum that he controls, may decide to buy common stock in the company on his own behalf. Quantum had recently notified the Federal Trade Commission under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 that it might buy up to 49.9 pct of Fairchild's voting stock. Unless the FTC had objected, Quantum would have been free, but not obligated, to buy up to 49.9 pct of Fairchild stock. Fairchild management, however, warned that if Quantum, a foreign entity, raises its stake in the company to 49.9 pct, it could ""impair"" the government security clearances Fairchild needs to carry out its its defense contract work. In response, Quantum said it told Fairchild it will not make ""significant additional purchases"" of its common or preferred stock without giving Fairchild enough prior notice to enable it to consult with Quantum over the impact of action. Quantum also said it has withdrawn its notification request to the FTC and the antitrust division of the Justice Department of its intent to buy up to 49.9 pct of Fairchild.

PUBLISHED-TESTSET,"['interest', 'money-fx', 'gnp']","Kuwait, a major oil producer hit by last year's price slump, is leaning towards a more creative monetary policy to help spur its economy, banking sources said. ""There is a clear emphasis on encouraging the use of money in productive ventures, rather than having it all tied up in interest bearing investments which have no direct productive outlet,"" one banker said. Kuwait's Central Bank yesterday cut one key money market rate and abandoned another which had been used since February 1986 to direct inter-bank borrowing and lending costs. The bank reduced to six pct from 6-1/2 pct the rate at which it will offer funds of one month to one year in the inter-bank market. This, in turn, affected retail rates. The cut, the third this year, followed a major overhaul of interest rate policy last month which Central Bank Governor Sheikh Salem Abdul-Aziz al-Sabah said was designed to revive the economy. One banker said ""There is growing flexibility, creativity, in interest rate policy, amid an awareness of the need to diversify the economy by stimulating the non-oil sector."" For the first time in nearly three years domestic interest rates are now significantly below those for the U.S. Dollar, a favourite haven for Gulf speculative and investor funds in the past, banking sources said. Despite uncertainties generated by the 6-1/2 year old Iran- Iraq war on Kuwait's northern doorstep, bankers play down the prospect of any significant capital flight. The Kuwaiti dinar, whose value is set by the Central Bank and was fixed today at 0.27095/129 to the dollar, is stronger now than for several years. Fears that the dollar may fall further will prompt second thoughts among Kuwaiti investors prepared to consider switching funds into the U.S. Currency, the sources said. ""There is a distinct exchange rate risk,"" they added. Bankers said the dollar slump hurt many investors behind the last major capital outflow in 1984, encouraged then by 18 pct U.S. Interest rates and the start of Iranian attacks on neutral shipping in the Gulf. The Central Bank calculates its dinar exchange rate against a basket of currencies. Bankers do not know the basket's exact make-up but say it is weighted heavily in favour of the dollar. Some bankers believe any strengthening of the dinar beyond 0.27000 to the dollar might provoke investors into shifting funds into the U.S. Currency. ""They may ask:When will the dollar be so cheap again?"" one said. And with dinar interest rates now roughly one pct below those for the dollar, they say the Central Bank faces a delicate balancing role requiring further flexibility. Bankers said the current, expansionary interest rate policy is only part of a broader attempt to encourage local investment and strengthen the backbone of the economy. They estimate the economy, measured in terms of GDP and allowing for inflation, shrank 19 pct in 1986 after an 8.1 pct contraction the previous year. Bankers also noted recent measures to stimulate stock market activity, capped today by sharp cuts in brokerage fees to make it cheaper for investors to trade. REUTER &#3;"

PUBLISHED-TESTSET,['trade'],"Congress returned from its Easter recess ready for the annual Spring budget battle that promises to be a partisan dispute. The budget fight pitting Democrats against President Reagan and Republicans is expected to get underway this week in the Senate late this week and last at least another week. It is taking on new prominence because of current trade woes. That is because the budget problems and its associated huge deficits are said to be at the root of related international trade friction currently worrying financiers. As the dollar slides downward on global markets and stock exchanges gyrate wildly, the trade dispute involving the United States and Japan once again is spreading fears of a major trade war between the two trading giants for the first time since World War II. Ostensibly that dispute is over U.S. charges that Japan is refusing to open its markets to semi-conductor chips and the resulting U.S. tariffs doubling prices of Japanese televisions and small computers. Behind the elements of a brewing trade war which neither side wants, is the dilemma of the U.S. budget and its deficit. Some analysts say the financial markets may be waking up to the economic realities that the huge debt cannot continue to grow without repercussions. A large portion of the U.S. debt has been financed by foreigners from their accumulated trade surpluses. But if they withdraw this support the result can only be further problems, including higher interest rates for Americans. In a nutshell, the U.S. budget process has now moved to the showdown stages in Congress. Reagan's own trillion dollar spending budget for the government year 1988, starting Oct. 1, was trounced badly in the House on April 9. The Senate takes up a plan similar to one that passed the House, calling for slashing the deficit from its estimated 171 billion dlr level next year to about 134 billion dlrs, through defense and domestic spending cuts and about 18.5 billion dlrs in new, unspecified, taxes. As the Senate prepares to take up its own budget plan, majority Democrats predict there will be passage of a bill, only after a protracted partisan battle. In the House, not one Republican voted for the budget, which passed by 230 to 192. In the Senate, none of Reagan's Republicans voted for the budget as it passed out of the Senate Budget Committee for full Senate consideration. A key Senate Budget Committee source told Reuters he believes this very unusual unanimous opposition was by design among congressional Republicans, perhaps with the tacit approval of the White House. ""Republicans want Democrats to take the heat for any tax hikes and defense cuts,"" he said. In the coming weeks, the source said, Democrats will press for a bipartisan budget and seek a negotiated budget with Reagan -- who already is opposed to the idea. But ""it is not clear how the Republicans will act,"" he added. He said Republicans may propose their own plan for lower taxes and more defense spending, which they did not offer after Reagan's budget was clobbered in an early vote in the House. When Reagan entered the White House in 1981, he inherited what was labelled a huge deficit from Jimmy Carter that wound up to be nearly 79 billion dlrs that year. Despite Reagan's promise to balance the budget by 1983, critics note that his administration's record of accumulated debt is estimated over one trillion dlrs, or 1,100 billion dlrs. That is money the government must borrow, and pay back, and many analysts say it is what kept the dollar high and caused the worst U.S. trade deficit ever. Last year the United States bought goods from the world worth 169.8 billion dlrs more than what it sold, including purchases of 58.6 billion dlrs in Japanese goods. While Congress is trying to attack the trade deficit on one front through a get-tough trade bill promising retaliatory measures unless all markets are opened, its success so far against the budget deficit has been marked by limited progress. Congress, which controls the pursestrings, has put the deficit on a downward path from its record high of 220.7 billion dlrs accumulated in fiscal 1986, which ended Sept. 30. Because of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings balanced budget law enacted in late 1985, there has been pressure on Congress to do more than talk about deficits. That law, named after Republican Senators Phil Gramm of Texas, Warren Rudman of New Hampshire and Democrat Ernest Hollings of South Carolina, calls for a balanced budget by 1991 through a series of set deficit targets that Congress must meet. The law has been followed, even though an enforcement mechanism to mandate automatic across-the-board cuts if Congress misses its goal was stricken by the Supreme Court. The legislators have followed the targets -- on paper. But in reality, the goal has actually been missed. For example, Congress last year approved legislation to meet the 1987 target of a 144 billion dlr deficit. But even after approving the numbers, the deficit for 1987 is estimated at over 170 billion dlrs -- far off the target. This year the target is 108 billion dlrs and that goal is expected to be missed widely. Reuter &#3;"

Prices rose 8.3 pct last year. The March rise included a 0.05 pct increase correcting an error in last January's consumer price index. Economists had earlier said the error could have been as high as 0.2 pct. De la Dehesa said seasonal increases in food prices pushed the index up in March and he expected the rate to be lower in April. The Communist-led Workers Commissions union said the March price rise showed inflation was going up again and the government looked increasingly unlikely to meet its five pct target. The Workers Commissions said the inflation trend fuelled unions's claims to wage increases beyond the government's recomendation to limit wage rises at around five pct. Spain is being affected by a two-month-old wave of strikes for wage rises. Government officials note wage settlements so far this year have yielded average increases upwards of six pct, while unions say the figure is higher then seven pct. REUTER &#3;"

Languetin said certain changes would probably be necessary in the ""too expansive"" monetary policy of the United States, adding that there was a prevailing view that U.S. Money supply was expanding too strongly. ""If this should last long the dollar could only be stabilised at the cost of a substantial easing in monetary policy on the part of the other central banks, which would in turn create the basis for a new wave of world-wide inflation,"" he said.

It made a similar request in January when Japanese buyers agreed to postpone some 200,000 tonnes of sugar deliveries for 1987 until 1988.

Japanese buyers are believed to have contracts to buy some 950,000 tonnes of raw sugar from Cuba for 1987 shipment. But Japan's actual raw sugar imports from Cuba are likely to total only some 400,000 to 450,000 tonnes this year, against 576,990 in 1986, reflecting both the postponements and sales earlier this year by Japanese traders of an estimated 150,000 tonnes of Cuban sugar to the USSR for 1987 shipment, they said.

Charles Chen told Reuters the original three year accord has been extended by one year to the end of 1989. The U.S. Has agreed to raise the limit on annual growth of Taiwan's textile and apparel exports to one pct from 0.5 pct for calendar 1989, he said. ""The new accord is more fair and gives breathing space to our textile makers (so they can) diversify their exports to other nations,"" he added. Chen said the revised agreement puts Taiwan on similar textile exporting terms to Hong Kong and South Korea. But despite the changes, Taiwanese firms have lost orders to rivals in Hong Kong and South Korea because of the strong Taiwan dollar, he said. The Taiwan currency has risen 17 pct against the U.S. Dollar since September 1985 while the Korean won rose by some six pct and the Hong Kong dollar was stable. Taiwan's textile exports to the U.S. Amounted to 2.8 billion U.S. Dlrs last year out of total exports to the U.S. Of 7.8 billion. Textile exports are expected to remain the same this year, Chen said.

PUBLISHED-TESTSET,['trade'],"Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) drew up a final plan to expand domestic demand and boost imports in time for Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's visit to Washington next week, LDP officials said. The plan calls for additional fiscal measures worth more than 5,000 billion yen, a large-scale supplementary budget for the current fiscal year started April 1, and concentration of more than 80 pct of the annual public works budget in the first half of the year, they said. Nakasone will explain the measures to U.S. Officials during his visit to Washington starting April 29.  The LDP plan will be the basis for a government package of pump-priming measures expected to be unveiled in late May. The LDP said Japan should do more to reduce its trade surplus. Its plan is expected to help increase economic growth led by domestic demand, officials said. The government was also urged to review the ceiling on budgetary requests for investment purposes in 1988/89. The government has imposed a five pct cut in investment outlays in the past five years in line with Nakasone's avowed policy of fiscal reforms.  The plan called on Japan to promote government purchases of foreign goods and private sector imports of manufactured goods by improving import financing, and to make clear official procurement procedures for foreign supercomputers. The LDP also said Japan should contribute further to society at large through measures such as doubling its official development assistance to 7.6 billion dlrs in five years or so instead of seven years as the government had originally promised. The government was urged to work out a program to recycle funds from Japan's trade surpluses to debt-ridden countries.  The officials said the funds to be recycled would include those from the private sector and others provided through the government Export-Import Bank of Japan and Japan's Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund. The plan also calls for the government to take steps to help the development of African and other less developed nations. The LDP called for adequate and flexible management of monetary policy, such as a cut in interest rates on deposits with the Finance Ministry's Trust Fund, and a tax cut to promote plant and equipment investment.

PUBLISHED-TESTSET,['trade'],"The visit this week by a special Japanese envoy has done little to defuse Japan's trade frictions with the United States, U.S. and congressional leaders say. White House and congressional leaders took a wait-and-see stance, after a series of meetings with former Japanese Foreign Minister Shintaro Abe, who was here paving the way for the April 29-May 2 visit of Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone.  They are withholding judgment until Nakasone's visit, with one senator saying Japan had promised to stimulate its economy and open its markets to foreign goods in the past, but it was time now for action. The U.S. trade deficit last year was a record 169.8 billion dlrs, with more than one-third of it in trade with Japan. Congress is ready to approve tough trade legislation to try to turn around the deficit, which has cost millions of U.S. jobs and closed thousands of factories. Much of the anger has been directed at Japan. U.S.-Japan trade friction was further fueled by President Reagan's April 17 decision to impose 100 pct tariffs on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese goods in retaliation for unfair practices in semiconductor trade. Reagan said he imposed the tariffs on personal computers, television sets and hand tools because Japan failed to keep an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at less than cost and to open its home market to U.S. products.  Abe had asked Reagan to end the tariffs quickly, but U.S. officials said the curbs would not be dropped until Japan had shown it was honoring the pact, which could take several months. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, asked if Nakasone's visit might help to defuse trade tensions, said ""whether progress can be made depends on how you want to measure it."" He added, ""I would expect progress to be made. If you want to measure that in terms of lifting the sanctions, that's more doubtful."" Congressmen were equally skeptical. Abe met Senate and Democratic leaders active in trade legislation, telling them of Japan's plan to spur domestic spending by 34 billion dlrs and open its markets to a wide range of goods, including supercomputers and farm products. Sen. John Danforth, a Missouri Republican, said after the meeting, ""We have heard promises in the past, but the question now is whether there will be real action."" Abe also met House leaders pressing for a tough trade bill, including Congressman Richard Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat. Gephardt is sponsoring legislation to penalize nations with large deficits and which are guilty of unfair trade practices. Gephardt's legislation would hit Japan, as well as Taiwan, South Korea, and West Germany. The bill is expected to pass the House next week - coinciding with Nakasone's visit - but its fate in the more moderate Senate is uncertain. A bipartisan group of senators, however, told Nakasone in a letter released as Abe was holding Senate meetings, that fresh Japanese-U.S. trade strife would erupt if Japan's markets were not soon opened to American goods. The signers included Democratic leader Robert Byrd of West Virginia, Republican leader Robert Dole of Kansas and others ranging from moderate to hardline on trade issues. They said in the letter there was growing U.S. sentiment that Japan was fighting opening its markets and ""evidence to the contrary is necessary to combat this perception, or it is likley that additional efforts will be attempted to close off the American market to Japanese goods.

In the paper Bangemann wrote, ""It is not possible to reduce the U.S. Current account deficit by any signficant amount just through more stimulation of the West German economy."" One U.S. Administration policy maker said in Washington this week that the United States government wanted West Germany and Japan to reduce their interest rates even further to stimulate their economies. Bangemann said it was clear the high mark, as well as uncertainty about further currency developments, was making companies here cautious about production plans and investments. While West Germany did not seek exchange rates which unilaterally favoured its exports, it favoured more stability and realistic rates, which corresponded to ""fundamentals."" He welcomed the February ""Louvre Agreement"" of six industrial nations to stabilise currencies and said, ""(We) expect all parties to hold by the accords struck there.""

They were responding to EC Commission sources in Brussels saying West German producers have withdrawn most of the 79,250 tonnes of the sugar they put into intervention on April 1. The traders said it is also likely that French producers, who put over 700,000 tonnes into intervention, will withdraw a significant proportion of this for the same reason before they are due to accept payment for the sugar in early May. Earlier this week traders said the stepping up of the level of export licences being granted by the EC at recent tenders, with generous subsidies, had been due to producer threats to leave the sugar in intervention and to a desire to move most of the old crop sugar before the new crop tenders start in May. The EC has so far granted licences for 2,467,970 tonnes out of around 3.1 mln tonnes targetted for export in the 1986/87 series of tenders. This would indicate the likelihood of high tonnages continuing to be moved over the next few tenders and subsidies also remaining high in order to attract producer bids for the export licences, traders said.

The government also said in the plan, made available to Reuters, that a devaluation of the Ugandan shilling would do little to redress a chronic balance of payments deficit. The plan, the first since President Yoweri Museveni took power 15 months ago, seeks to raise 2.4 billion dlrs in investment funds from abroad between 1987 and 1991. It says the government had already secured 1.4 billion dlrs in pledges before Islamic lenders promised a further 494 mln dlrs at a conference in Kampala last week. Uganda already had an external debt of 984 mln dlrs at the end of 1986 and in the nine months of the current budget debt servicing will cost 204 mln dlrs, almost 50 pct of export earnings of 431 mln, the plan said. The new fiscal measures include a proposed tax on large land holdings, regardless of whether the owners are exploiting them, and taxes on maize, beans and other crops sold by the Produce Marketing Board. The plan says the aim is to spread the tax burden, which in Uganda has traditionally fallen almost exclusively on coffee farmers. Coffee provides over 90 pct of foreign exchange earnings and more than 70 pct of government revenue. On exchange rate policy, it repeats Museveni's argument that any form of fotation would not help allocating resources. Western governments and multilateral funds say the Ugandan shilling is grossly overvalued and the government must change the exchange rate if it wishes to encourage investment.

""The M-1 surge will be very temporary. About two thirds of the increase is likely to be washed out in the following week,"" said Kim Rupert, an economist at Money Market Services Inc. Rupert said a huge increase in M-1 for the April 20 week is implied by very strong deposit survey data and by an unexpectedly sharp gain in required reserves in Federal Reserve data released Thursday. Those numbers, covering the two-week bank statement period that ended on April 22, show a 2.5 billion dlr jump in basic required reserves. Economists said this largely reflected the parking in checking accounts of the proceeds from stock market sales and mutual fund redemptions to pay annual income taxes. Fed seasonal adjustments do not adequately compensate for these and other special factors. Analysts noted that income tax refunds from the Treasury also appear to be coming earlier than usual. They also are not adequately compensated for by the Fed's seasonal adjustment factors to the money supply.

PUBLISHED-TESTSET,['gas'],"Unless U.S. refiners reduce the amount of gasoline they now produce, the oil industry will enter the coming summer driving season with the largest surplus of motor fuel since 1984, oil analysts and traders said. ""They key question is how much gasoline refiners produce in the coming weeks,"" said Larry Goldstein of Petroleum Industry Research Inc. ""If refiners cut output and demand turns upward, gasoline stocks could begin to draw, and the surplus could potentially turn around in four to eight weeks,"" said Goldstein. The American Petroleum Institute said U.S. gasoline stocks for the week ended April 17 are 37.6 mln barrels above last year's levels, and analysts said they don't believe the expected one to two pct rise in demand will take care of the surplus before the start of the summer driving season, which begins Memorial Day weekend. The API said the last time stocks were this high was in 1984, when there was a 27 mln barrel excess. Oil traders said that the surplus held throughout the summer of 1984, depressing prices for the motor fuel. Over the past several weeks, analysts said they expected refiners to reduce production because there was no profit in continued production of gasoline due to the surplus. However, refineries continued to operate at higher levels, they said. U.S. refineries have been running at about 78.8 pct of capacity during March and April this year, compared to 77.5 at this time last year, API statistics show. Because of the current excess in stocks, one planner for a major oil company said he believed that most companies are contemplating cutting refinery throughput over the near term. He said some refiners appear to be selling less aggressively in order to have product on hand to meet the expected rise in demand this summer. Goldstein said that other factors, such as higher speed limits, the gasoline lead phasedown, and possible new restrictions on gasoline vapor pressure could tighten the supply situation this summer. However, a planner at another major oil company said that although large inventories are dampening the price outlook for gasoline this season, he does not expect refiners to cut output soon. That oil company planner said high crude oil runs reduce the refiner's average costs, making the incremental barrel of gasoline cheaper to produce. Most analysts expect a slight upturn this summer over the summer of 1986. Bo Poates, an analyst at the Energy Futures Group Inc said he foresees demand up about one pct in the second and third quarters of 1987.

Pork bellies are expected 0.50 to 1.00 cent or more lower, the analysts said. Disappointment was voiced over the placement and total on feed figures in the cattle report. Both the quarterly section and monthly 7-state part showed the amount placed on feed and on feed numbers at the high end of expectations.

PUBLISHED-TESTSET,"['gnp', 'cpi', 'jobs']","High labour costs and slower corporate investment could hinder Sweden's economic growth after 1987, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, said. The Swedish economy grew at a slower rate in 1986 than in previous years. GDP rose about 1.7 pct in 1986 compared with 2.2 pct in 1985. But this growth depended largely on external factors, particularly lower oil prices, the OECD secretariat said in its latest annual report on Sweden. It warned that labour costs had risen more rapidly in Sweden than in other OECD countries. Because of high labour costs Swedish industry, which largely relies upon export markets, was losing market share. Wages in the manufacturing sector grew by seven pct in 1986, in line with 1985 increases, while public sector wages rose an estimated 9.2 pct in 1986, up from six pct in 1985. This was significantly higher than average wage increases of 3.75 pct for the seven largest members of the OECD in 1986. The report said wage moderation was central to maintaining economic growth in Sweden. It suggested that wage negotiations should be at least partly centralised to control the total wages bill and hold down inflation and unemployment levels. Helped by low oil prices and the government's tight fiscal policy, inflation fell to just over three pct in 1986 from almost six pct in 1985 but remained higher than in most other OECD countries, the report said. Unemployment, a principal policy target, was at 2.7 pct in 1986, in line with 1985's 2.8 pct and well below the OECD average of 8.6 pct. The report said Sweden's employment policies accounted for the high levels of wage inflation. It also said that economic growth in 1986 relied increasingly on private consumption because corporate investment in machinery and equipment had shrunk. The total volume of industrial investments dropped by two pct in 1986, with sharp declines in spending by the wood, pulp and paper industries. This compared to a 19 pct rise in 1985 when there was heavy investment in these industries. The OECD said Sweden should now make an effort to boost corporate investments and reduce its dependence on domestic consumption for economic growth. It suggested there was room for reform in the tax system. Sweden should continue to cut public sector spending, especially in local government, to keep in line with its tighter fiscal policy, the report said. REUTER &#3;"

Peru, the world's second biggest silver producer, stopped selling its refined silver and state-marketed ore on tuesday. Since then, the metal's price has risen to its highest level in nearly three years. It closed today at over nine dlrs an ounce on world markets. Garcia said the move showed that a small nation like Peru could move international markets and did not have to accept cheap prices for silver, traditionally one of the top revenue earners of the country. Peru exported its refined silver last year at an average price of 5.40 dlrs a troy ounce. As recently as one month ago, silver bullion was trading for about 5.70 dlrs an ounce on world markets. ""One thing is that Peru, which produces silver, sells it silently and in a submissive manner at the price world markets want,"" he told reporters at the presidential palace.

""They have some stocks, they have silver deposits, they can make fictitious sales and that way try to make the price of our mineral fall in the world market,"" Garcia said. ""Whatever manoeuvre they take will be answered by Peru,"" he said. ""Peru is in a position of action.""

""We are trying to keep the monetary framework tight, so that inflationary pressures cannot develop,"" he told the Frankfurter Neue Presse daily in an interview. ""Central bank money stock does not have to be reduced because of this, but it must continue to grow modestly,"" he said. Bundesbank spokesmen were not available for comment. On Thursday Schlesinger said in a contribution to the Handelsblatt daily that the accommodative monetary stance in West Germany caused by outside pressures could not determine policy in the long term. The improvement in West German terms of trade, providing room for non-inflationary expansion of domestic demand in excess of output growth, put the overshoot of central bank money stock in a more positive light, he said on Thursday. Central bank money stock, the Bundesbank's main monetary measure, was growing at an annual rate of 7.3 pct in March, above the 1987 three-six pct target range. Money stock overshot the 3.5-5.5 pct 1986 growth target. Schlesinger told the Frankfurter Neue Presse that the phase of falling prices was over in West Germany. Prices might still be lower on a comparison with their level one year earlier. But the cost of living index has risen to 120.7 in March from its November 1986 low of 120.0, expressing a slight rise in prices, Schlesinger said. In March the cost of living was steady against February but 0.2 pct below March 1986. Schlesinger said a rise of between one and 1.5 pct during 1987 would be acceptable, and effectively mean price stability. Agreements so far in the current West German wage round are neutral as far as inflation is concerned because of the strength of the mark, Schlesinger said. Wage agreements in the public service and engineering industry were relatively high in view of the stable cost of living. But the higher costs would be compensated for, he said. ""I am thinking above all of the fact that in the course of this year we will in all probability have a stronger mark against other currencies than last year,"" he said, adding ""Without this mark revaluation effect, we would have had to say that the wage rise agreements were not neutral for prices."" Schlesinger said exchange rate movements had increased the scope for redistributing wealth this year, but this development was unlikely to continue in 1988.

PUBLISHED-TESTSET,"['trade', 'grain', 'wheat']","Ministers from the major trading nations have for the first time made a concerted commitment to review the whole distorted structure of world farm trade, Canadian Trade Minister Patricia Carney said. ""We think we can get some movement on this,"" she told reporters at a briefing following informal talks with the U.S., Japanese and European Community (EC) trade ministers here. Canada, strongly supported by Australia, has championed the cause of both developed and developing nations which have seen their farm trade suffer largely due to a farm subsidy war between the United States and the EC. Japan""s protected agricultural markets have also attracted criticism. The issue is of extreme importance to many indebted, developing nations which often rely totally on one or two farm sector exports to sustain their economies but which cannot compete with the subsidised U.S. And EC products. ""Canada can afford so many billions of dollars (to do so), but many countries cannot,"" said Carney. She said the EC had changed its previous unhelpful attitude and had raised proposals similar to those of Canada under which to discuss the issue. Talks will now continue at the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which meets next month, and at the series of discussions on a new world trading framework, begun at Punta del Este, Uruguay, last year. Carney said Japan had also agreed to take a positive role in the farm talks, and that the United States was willing to see short-term progress, as long as long-term solutions were not affected. Canada""s five point programme demands that farm product prices must reflect open world market prices, that any support for farmers incomes should not be linked to production incentives, that there should be no new farm subsidies, no new farm import barriers, and that any decisions should be implemented collectively. The farm trade problem was almost completely ignored by the industrialised world until Canada raised it last year at the Tokyo summit of seven leading industrial powers. The distortions created by subsidies and protectionism have created some absurd situations. For example, to protect its farmers the Japanese government buys Canadian wheat and sells it at 10 times the purchase price to Japanese consumers. ""So we end up borrowing in the Japanese (financial) market to help pay subsidies to keep our farmers while they make a profit on our wheat to help pay the price support for their farmers,"" said Carney. The problem causes pain for many nations and increases the already dangerously high debts that they owe mainly to U.S., Japanese and EC banks. REUTER &#3;"
PUBLISHED-TESTSET,['crude'],"Bank profits in the Gulf oil state of Qatar are coming under renewed pressure and foreign banks are retrenching further in one of the region""s most overbanked markets. Results for 1986 show a year of declining profit for several foreign banks, although locally-owned operations were in some cases able to cushion the drop by increasing market share. &lt;Qatar National Bank SAQ>""s (QNB) General Manager, Abdulla Khalid al-Attiya, said: ""The economy is not improving as we hoped... 1987 will be another difficult year for the banks."" Oil-dependent Qatar, with a tiny indigenous population of 60,000 to 80,000 and an expatriate workforce estimated at about 280,000, boasts five local banks and 10 foreign bank operations. Local and foreign bankers in the capital said the Gulf-wide recession, aggravated this year by Qatar""s severe difficulty marketing its crude oil at official OPEC prices, has taken a heavy toll on the economy and bank profitability. As a result, the only U.S. Bank, &lt;Citibank NA>, is thought to be negotiating to sell its operation to the fast growing locally based &lt;Al Ahli Bank of Qatar QSC> which only started operations in 1984, bankers said. Citibank would not comment. Other foreign banks have retrenched, with &lt;Standard Chartered Bank> cutting staff and others expected to follow. &lt;Banque Paribas> is examining a change in its status to admit 51 pct Qatari ownership in a bid to improve its access to local business, bankers said. One banker added: ""Weak profits are here to stay for the time being. There is no cause for optimism at the moment."" Sentiment had picked up briefly at the end of last year when OPEC reached its accord to curb oil output and return to fixed prices. However, it soon became apparent that Qatar was having difficulty selling oil at OPEC prices. The soft spot oil market has left official Qatari crude prices 20 to 40 cents more expensive and sales have been running in recent weeks at 100,000 and 120,000 barrels per day, well down on the nation""s OPEC quota of 285,000, oil sources said. Bankers said this serious shortfall in Qatar""s revenue has led to a new spate of payments delays from the public sector to private contractors after a marginal improvement in January. Loan loss provisions continued to eat into bank profits last year, as did the introduction of minimum reserve requirements by the Qatar Monetary Agency. Trade financing has almost dried up as a traditional source of bank income. Of the local banks, QNB conducts the bulk of the government""s business and subsequently enjoys a huge advantage its rivals cannot expect to match, bankers said. The bank reported a 2.9 pct rise in net 1986 profit to 93.1 mln Qatari riyals, while its balance sheet grew by 10.8 pct to 9.0 billion, making it by far the largest bank in Qatar. But the strong assets growth partly reflected bridging loans for the public and private sector to tide government departments and local business over the lean economic spell, Attiya said. ""Generally speaking, we are overbanked in Qatar,"" he said, echoing a widespread feeling in the banking community. Other local banks fared less strongly. The second largest, &lt;Doha Bank Ltd QSC>, reported a 13 pct drop in net profit to 27.5 mln riyals, while &lt;Commercial Bank of Qatar Ltd QSC>, registered a decline to 18.5 mln riyals from 19.4 mln in 1985. The newcomer Al Ahli Bank, continued to expand rapidly and reported net profit of 5.2 mln compared with 3.3 mln during the start-up period from August 4, 1984 to end-1985. Bankers said the local banks had clearly begun to win commercial deposits previously held by foreign banks, increasing already strong pressure on non-Qatari banks to reexamine their staffing levels and overheads. &lt;Grindlays Bank PLC> recorded a net loss at its Doha branch last year of 4.7 mln riyals after registering a nominal profit in 1985 of 12,000 riyals. Two other long-established banks in the Gulf, the &lt;British Bank of the Middle East> (BBME) and Standard Chartered, also found last year a difficult climate to make strong profits. BBME""s net profit fell to 3.2 mln riyals from 10.4 mln in 1985, but Assistant Manager John Farquharson said 1985""s result had been artificially inflated by tax rebates on provisions. ""Foreign banks are seeing their assets decline, while local banks are increasing their market share,"" Farquharson said. BBME""s operating profit was steady in 1986, edging up to 12.3 mln riyals from 11.5 mln in 1985. ""We are expecting the same level of operating profit in 1987,"" Farquharson said. Standard Chartered""s net profit last year recovered slightly to 1.6 mln riyals after a loss of 161,000 in 1985. Staff numbers were cut last year to reduce overheads. Bankers said the lack of new construction projects in Qatar means business is unlikely to pick up this year although hopes are rising that the start of Qatari gas exploitation could provide a boost. But the threat of higher U.S. Interest rates may erode bank deposits as savings are moved offshore. REUTER &#3;"

In his weekly radio address on Saturday, Reagan said he would tell Nakasone: ""We want to continue to work cooperatively on trade problems and want very much to lift these trade restrictions as soon as evidence permits. Reagan said the 100 pct tariffs he imposed on some 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese goods was a special case of trade retaliation and did not signal a shift in what he called his staunch anti-protectionist policies.

""We need credibility to gain confidence. When we have confidence, then we can have an impact,"" said Tamura. His colleagues agreed that when major trade nations fought over trade issues while calling for each other to honour free trade rules in general, it was not a sight which inspired confidence in the markets. ""The time has come now to act in step with the talk. If you belong to a club, you have to act in concord with the rules, if you want to be credible,"" said EC external trade chief Willy de Clercq. Canadian Trade Minister Patricia Carney also agreed: ""We are meeting in a time of great trade tension.

She said that next month""s meeting of the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development and the meeting of leaders of the G-7 nations in Venice in the summer would be a forum to show this will existed. U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter reminded the news conference that the results of such high level meetings could lead to action which would only have an effect on smoothing out world trade imbalances perhaps years later. ""The media typically has a tendency to evaluate meetings like this in terms of tangible results. That is not the way it should be pursued,"" he said. ""What is achieved in an intangible way almost always exceeds what is achieved in a tangible way,"" he said. Progress in personal contacts and understanding each others"" positions and policies was just as important toward reducing trade tensions, he said. Tamura read out an agreed summary of the joint talks: Currency stability was now essential, but currency movements alone would not correct a U.S. Trade deficit with Japan which hit 58 billion dlrs last year, an 18 billion dlr EC deficit with Japan in 1986, and a Japanese global trade surplus of almost 90 billion, he said. Trade retaliation, protectionism, and forcible export restraints which lead to a shrinkage in world trade flows were most dangerous, he said. The imbalances can only be solved by coordinated policies over a whole range of fiscal, monetary, trade and industrial measures, and in line with a body of internationally agreed rules, he said. In this regard, the policing role of the Geneva-based General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade world trade body must be strengthened, he said. The ministers reconfirmed their individual promises to solve the problem. The United States will try to reduce its large budget deficit and restore competitiveness within its industries. Japan will introduce early and effective measures to expand its domestic growth and rely less on exports. The EC must continue efforts for balanced growth and reduced unemployment.

Diplomats said key EC capitals would voice strong criticism of proposals that would lead to a sharp increase in EC budget payments by bringing member states"" contributions more into line with national wealth. They said the EC""s current paymasters, Britain, France, and West Germany, would lead the opposition to the plans, designed to enable the community meet the challenges of the 1990s. Faced with a budget deficit this year of at least five billion dlrs, EC Commission President Jacques Delors called in February for a radical overhaul of the EC financing system. Such action was necessary, he argued, to end a damaging cycle of annual budget crises and ensure cash for technological research programs and regional and social spending projects. Ironically, diplomats said, the move could spark exactly the type of row it was intended to avoid with industrially developed northern states demanding assurances the new cash would not be swallowed up by the poorer southern members. Delors"" plans, by linking a country""s contributions to its Gross National Product (GNP), would over the next five years add some 18 billion dlrs to the present budget of 34 billion. Currently, contributions are calculated on a percentage of Value Added Tax (VAT) returns. Under the new scheme, all countries would pay one pct of their VAT receipts to Brussels. Extra cash would then be raised in line with needs by a levy on the difference between a country""s total VAT receipts and its GNP. London is one of the most resolutely opposed countries to the scheme, arguing instead that money should be made available from deep cutbacks in the EC""s heavily-subsidised farm sector. Unofficially many EC capitals secretly support the wearisome budget wrangling, taking the line that the highly diverse 12-nation Community can only take tough decisions when forced to do so. The issue is further complicated by a possible general election in Britain and acceptance that the EC problems cannot seriously be addressed by London until those polls are out of the way.

PUBLISHED-TESTSET,['sugar'],"Good soaking rain is boosting the sugar cane crop in the key Mackay region of Queensland following a prolonged dry spell relieved only by intermittent falls, an Australian Sugar Producers Association spokesman told Reuters. The rains began late last week, developed into heavy downpours over the weekend and are continuing today, he said from Brisbane. The Mackay and Burdekin regions, which together grow about half the Australian cane crop, have been the Queensland cane areas hardest hit by unseasonal dry weather since December. The spokesman said the rain missed the Burdekin area, just to the north of the Mackay region on the central Queensland coastal fringe, although recent light showers have freshened the crop there. Owing to the dry spell in the Mackay and Burdekin areas, the overall 1987 Australian cane crop is likely to be below the 25.4 mln tonnes crushed in 1986 for a 94 net titre raws outturn of 3.37 mln tonnes, he said. But any decline will not be as great as seemed likely a couple of months ago when it appeared the Mackay-Burdekin crops were going to suffer badly, he said. Preliminary crop estimates are expected to be available early next month, the spokesman said. The crush in the Mackay-Burdekin is likely to start later this year, in late June or early July against mid-June last year, to allow the cane to grow and sweeten further, he said. The crush normally runs to around the end of December. Elsewhere in the sugar belt, the cane is doing well, with some mill areas expecting record crops, he said. Industry records show variations in the crop are not always mirrored in raws output. In 1985, 24.4 mln tonnes of sweeter cane than in 1986 produced 3.38 mln tonnes of raws. REUTER &#3;"

PUBLISHED-TESTSET,['money-supply'],"Central bank money stock was growing at about seven pct in the first quarter of 1987, down from 9-1/2 pct in the second half of 1986, so there are signs that the pace of growth is slowing even though it is still above target, the Bundesbank said in its 1986 annual report. The Bundesbank set a target range of three to six pct growth from fourth quarter 1986 to fourth quarter 1987 for central bank money stock. In the previous year it grew 7.7 pct, outside the 3-1/2 to 5-1/2 pct target range. The Bundesbank noted that monetary policy in 1986 was limited by a series of external factors. These included the revaluation of the mark, growing foreign payments surpluses of non-banks, and currency inflows. The Bundesbank therefore tolerated the monetary overshoot in 1986, as an attempt to counter monetary expansion with interest rate and liquidity moves would have increased upward pressure on the mark, it said. The lower end of the 1987 target range would be realistic if a large part of funds currently held in a liquid form were invested in long-term bank accounts or bonds, public bonds or foreign securities, the Bundesbank said. But if companies and private households continue to hold their funds in liquid forms, or if there are further currency inflows, growth will be closer to the upper end of the range. ""The more the conflict between external constraints and domestic objectives relaxes -- and many things point to this at the time of writing this report -- the more possible it will be to do justice again to the medium-term concept of money supply control,"" the Bundesbank said. It noted that prices were beginning to tend upwards again at the start of 1987. There would be virtually no easing of other production costs in 1987 to compensate for the rise in unit-wage costs. ""Nevertheless, no inflationary trends are likely to set in this year,"" the Bundesbank said. A link between excessive monetary growth and intensifying price rises can only be observed in the long term, it added. The continuing trend for non-banks to switch into long-term borrowing to take advantage of low interest rates, while for the same reason shunning long-term investments, increases the risks in changing interest rates for banks refinancing themselves with variable-interest deposits, it added.

PUBLISHED-TESTSET,['money-fx'],"Attempts to hold currency rates rigidly within tight ranges through European Monetary System intramarginal intervention can be counterproductive, bringing funds into the stronger currency from the weaker at rates still considered fairly favourable, the Bundesbank said. ""The movements thus sparked can actually promote the weaker tendency of a currency, requiring still larger obligatory intervention when rates hit band limits,"" it said in its 1986 annual report. The other danger was that money supply expansion could be caused in the stronger currency nation without its central bank being involved in the activity. ""For this reason, currency levels should be allowed as much room for manoeuvre as possible inside the band limits when a currency is in a phase of weakness,"" the Bundesbank said. ""In addition, speculative positions are made more expensive to hold when interest differentials are increased."" In the report, the Bundesbank gave a rare glimpse of the extent of intramarginal and obligatory EMS intervention that has taken place since the foundation of the eight-currency system on March 13, 1979. Obligatory intervention is that required by EMS central banks when a currency reaches its agreed limit against another participating unit. Intramarginal intervention is undertaken on agreement between central banks when speculative pressure moves a currency in an unwanted direction, although it may not yet be near any allowed EMS limits. At the start of this year, central banks were very actively selling marks and supporting weaker currencies, primarily the French franc, as speculative EMS pressure grew. But the announcement by the Bank of France that it was ceasing intramarginal intervention sent the franc straight to its then-permitted floor of 31.8850 marks per 100. Data in the Bundesbank report showed the EMS central banks bought a net total 29.9 billion marks after the April 6, 1986 realignment until the selling petered out on July 7. But this was far outweighed by net purchases between July 8, 1986, and the realignment on January 12 this year totalling 63.0 billion marks - 44.1 billion of which was intramarginal and 18.9 billion was obligatory intervention. The data showed that 17.4 billion marks of the total eventually filtered into the West German monetary system. Since the latest realignment, central banks have bought 16.1 billion marks in intramarginal intervention, the Bundesbank said, without naming the banks involved. Only very high activity after the March 21, 1983 realignment came close to matching moves up to last January. Then, central banks bought a massive 61.6 billion marks in the period up to July 1985, mainly to stabilise the EMS as the dollar surged. This then turned into mark sales of a net 34.0 billion from July 11, 1985 in the run-up to the April 1986 realignment. REUTER &#3;"

He said the U.S. Has followed a policy of weakening world rice prices by announcing highly subsidised export prices lower than those quoted by Thai traders. Thai officials said weekly rice prices as announced by the U.S. Agriculture Department were unchanged for 11 weeks up to April 8. Thailand, a major rice exporter, has criticised the U.S. Farm Act which provides heavy subsidies to U.S. Exporters enabling them to compete with Thai exporters. Thai officials said average export prices of Thai rice fell 19 pct last year and another 5.8 pct during the first quarter this year. The Board of Trade said Thailand exported 1.23 mln tonnes in January/March, down from 1.29 mln a year ago. It said the export decline was partly due to the reluctance of Thai traders to accept all foreign orders as world prices did not rise in line with firming domestic prices. The board said, however, that Thailand may export more rice later this year, especially to Africa, the Middle East and Asia, due to lower production in many drought affected African countries and to expected small exportable surpluses in Burma and Pakistan.

If OPEC does not increase overall output in the second half of the year, prices will tend to increase, because non-OPEC producers have not been able to produce more oil at current prices, he said. But he declined to predict, when asked after the meeting, whether OPEC would raise its production ceiling of 15.8 mln barrels at its next meeting in June. He said in his speech that world oil production over the last two months was estimated at 45.6 mln barrels a day, or two mln barrels a day less than world oil demand. Oil production by industrialized countries, particularly the U.S. And Canada, is expected to decrease this year, but some of that slack will be taken up by increased production in Cameroon, India and other developing countries, he said. This year is a battle between OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers and consumers in the industrialized world for the upper hand in world oil markets, Subroto said in an earlier speech to management trainees at Pertamina Oil Company. ""If OPEC emerges the winner, than it can gradually resume its former role in world oil markets,"" he said.

MEES said this contradicted recent hints of new Saudi price hawkishness from U.S. Congressional and oil industry sources. The Saudi sources said their policy was firmly based on the long-term need to restore the competitive position of oil in general and OPEC oil in particular against other energy sources. ""Saudi Arabia is certainly committed to cooperating with its OPEC partners to exercise the necessary production restraint to maintain the 18 dlr per barrel reference price level,"" MEES said. The newsletter said Saudi output in the first three weeks of April averaged slightly above its OPEC quota of 4.133 mln barrels per day (bpd).

PUBLISHED-TESTSET,['trade'],"Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, beleaguered by political turmoil at home, sets out Wednesday on a tough mission to Washington aimed at defusing the most serious U.S.-Japanese trade tension in recent memory. Two rounds of talks between President Reagan and Nakasone, scheduled for Thursday and Friday, come on the heels of the imposition by the United States of punitive tariffs on Japanese goods for the first time since World War Two. In the past, bilateral trade friction involving cotton goods, steel, television sets, textiles and cars have ended with Japan taking on voluntary export curbs. Nakasone's visit could coincide with the passage of a protectionist trade bill by the U.S. House of Representatives. A proposed amendment to the bill, drafted by Representative Richard Gephardt of Missouri, will mandate a 10 pct annual reduction in the trade surpluses of Japan and other nations which have large trade gaps with the United States. The United States last year had a record trade deficit of 169.8 billion dlrs and Japan accounted for about one-third. Foreign Ministry spokesman Yoshifumi Matsuda said recently he was reasonably optimistic about the results of talks between the two leaders. Top U.S. and Japanese officials have shuttled back and forth across the Pacific to lay the groundwork for Nakasone's visit. The last of the talks leading up to the main event will be in Washington next Wednesday between U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz and Foreign Minister Tadashi Kuranari. Nakasone will have an economic package worked out by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and by an advisory body led by former Bank of Japan Governor Haruo Maekawa. Japan plans to spend over 5,000 billion yen to boost domestic demand, increase imports of U.S. products including supercomputers and give more help to developing countries, government officials said. The government has been making last ditch efforts in time for Nakasone's trip to address outstanding bilateral issues, officials said. The issues include foreign access to a new Japanese overseas telecommunications venture and a six billion dlr international airport project in western Japan. Nakasone and his party last week reached a compromise accord with opposition parties over a controversial sales tax plan in exchange for parliamentary passage by the Lower House of a government draft budget for 1987/88. The accord, offered by House Speaker Kenzaburo Hara, virtually killed the Nakasone-sponsored plan, but left room for future tax reform plans, political analysts said. Nakasone, who led his party to a resounding electoral triumph last July, saw his popularity drop because of the sales tax. His party suffered setbacks in an Upper House by-election and nationwide local elections in the past two months. Mitsuru Uchida, professor of political science at Waseda University, told Reuters: ""I doubt that whatever Nakasone does in Washington -- no matter how good it might be -- would help restore his weakened power-base at home.""

PUBLISHED-TESTSET,['money-fx'],"Attempts to hold currency rates rigidly within tight ranges through European Monetary System intramarginal intervention can be counterproductive, bringing funds into the stronger currency from the weaker at rates still considered fairly favourable, the Bundesbank said. ""The movements thus sparked can actually promote the weaker tendency of a currency, requiring still larger obligatory intervention when rates hit band limits,"" it said in its 1986 annual report. The other danger was that money supply expansion could be caused in the stronger currency nation without its central bank being involved in the activity.  ""For this reason, currency levels should be allowed as much room for manoeuvre as possible inside the band limits when a currency is in a phase of weakness,"" the Bundesbank said. ""In addition, speculative positions are made more expensive to hold when interest differentials are increased."" In the report, the Bundesbank gave a rare glimpse of the extent of intramarginal and obligatory EMS intervention that has taken place since the foundation of the eight-currency system on March 13, 1979.  Obligatory intervention is that required by EMS central banks when a currency reaches its agreed limit against another participating unit. Intramarginal intervention is undertaken on agreement between central banks when speculative pressure moves a currency in an unwanted direction, although it may not yet be near any allowed EMS limits. At the start of this year, central banks were very actively selling marks and supporting weaker currencies, primarily the French franc, as speculative EMS pressure grew.  But the announcement by the Bank of France that it was ceasing intramarginal intervention sent the franc straight to its then-permitted floor of 31.8850 marks per 100. Data in the Bundesbank report showed the EMS central banks bought a net total 29.9 billion marks after the April 6, 1986 realignment until the selling petered out on July 7. But this was far outweighed by net purchases between July 8, 1986, and the realignment on January 12 this year totalling 63.0 billion marks - 44.1 billion of which was intramarginal and 18.9 billion was obligatory intervention.  The data showed that 17.4 billion marks of the total eventually filtered into the West German monetary system. Since the latest realignment, central banks have bought 16.1 billion marks in intramarginal intervention, the Bundesbank said, without naming the banks involved. Only very high activity after the March 21, 1983 realignment came close to matching moves up to last January. Then, central banks bought a massive 61.6 billion marks in the period up to July 1985, mainly to stabilise the EMS as the dollar surged. This then turned into mark sales of a net 34.0 billion from July 11, 1985 in the run-up to the April 1986 realignment.  REUTER &#3;"

""We need credibility to gain confidence. When we have confidence, then we can have an impact,"" said Tamura. His colleagues agreed that when major trade nations fought over trade issues while calling for each other to honour free trade rules in general, it was not a sight which inspired confidence in the markets.

U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter reminded the news conference that the results of such high level meetings could lead to action which would only have an effect on smoothing out world trade imbalances perhaps years later. ""The media typically has a tendency to evaluate meetings like this in terms of tangible results. That is not the way it should be pursued,"" he said. ""What is achieved in an intangible way almost always exceeds what is achieved in a tangible way,"" he said. Progress in personal contacts and understanding each others' positions and policies was just as important toward reducing trade tensions, he said. Tamura read out an agreed summary of the joint talks: Currency stability was now essential, but currency movements alone would not correct a U.S. trade deficit with Japan which hit 58 billion dlrs last year, an 18 billion dlr EC deficit with Japan in 1986, and a Japanese global trade surplus of almost 90 billion, he said. Trade retaliation, protectionism, and forcible export restraints which lead to a shrinkage in world trade flows were most dangerous, he said. The imbalances can only be solved by coordinated policies over a whole range of fiscal, monetary, trade and industrial measures, and in line with a body of internationally agreed rules, he said. In this regard, the policing role of the Geneva-based General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade world trade body must be strengthened, he said. The ministers reconfirmed their individual promises to solve the problem. The United States will try to reduce its large budget deficit and restore competitiveness within its industries. Japan will introduce early and effective measures to expand its domestic growth and rely less on exports. The EC must continue efforts for balanced growth and reduced unemployment.

The government said this would help freeze this year's trade surplus with the United States at the 1986 level. ""The surplus, which rose to 7.4 billion dollars last year from 4.3 billion in 1985, was projected to top 10 billion this year but the government has taken steps to constrain it to the seven billion dollar level,"" one Trade Ministry official told Reuters. A government statement said the 2.6 billion dlrs was in addition to about two billion dlrs of purchases made last month by a South Korean trade mission to the United States. The announcement follows a visit here this week by U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige, who said that if South Korea wanted to avoid protectionist retaliation it should not falter in its policies to open its market and cut its surplus. The statement said the government, state agencies and other public institutions would buy 480 mln dlrs worth of U.S. Cars, computers, helicopters, ambulances, motorcycles, medical and laboratory equipment and other products. ""This amounts includes 89 mln dlrs worth of purchases which were not originally reflected in their budgets,"" it added.

Agriculture Ministry officials said South Korea had already bought 310 mln dlrs worth of U.S. Wheat, raw cotton, corn and soybeans. This meant the country would buy from the United States nearly all of the 1.27 billion dlrs of its planned imports of such commodities this year, they said. The government will also take steps to reduce tariffs, accelerate the opening of its markets, voluntarily restrain exports and cut export financing, the statement said.

PUBLISHED-TESTSET,"['dlr', 'money-fx', 'interest']","Pressure is growing in the financial markets for the U.S. to take overt action to stabilize the dollar even though doubts linger that it has fallen far enough to help redress world trade imbalances, economists and dealers said. Some experts believe that a half-point increase in the U.S. discount rate, preferably in conjunction with rate cuts in Tokyo and Bonn, would be enough to discourage sellers. But many fear that more drastic action, such as a U.S. issue of yen-denominated Treasury bonds, may be needed. Despite official warnings about the dangers of a further dollar decline and concerted central bank intervention, the dollar extended its recent sharp depreciation, touching a 40-year low of 137.25 yen in Tokyo earlier today after closing here on Friday at 139.30/40. The impact on other financial markets was devastating. In Tokyo, the stock market suffered its largest single day decline; in London, gold bullion prices rose to four-year highs and in the U.S., long Treasury bond yields surged above 8.80 pct and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 40 points in hectic early trading. ""The problem now is linkage. This is not just a currency problem. It is affecting all the markets,"" said one senior trader at a major U.S. bank. Up until September of last year, international efforts to redress world trade imbalances appeared to working like a dream; the dollar was falling in an orderly manner, world interest rates were tumbling and inflation was kept in check. In recent months, however, this strategy has begun to show signs of severe stress, with the U.S. imposition of punitive tariffs on Japan threatening to unravel this spirit of cooperating and condemn the world to a damaging trade war. ""The markets fear that we have built up a momentum that is really difficult to stop. A U.S. rate hike has become an inevitability,"" one currency dealer said. ""At this point, nothing short of a Fed discount rate increase, ideally combined with further discount rate cuts by Japan and Germany, would seem capable of stabilizing the dollar,"" said David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston and Co Inc. Allen Sinai of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc predicted a 1/4 to 1/2 point U.S. rate increase before May 19 and a rise in U.S. bank prime lending rates to eight pct from 7-3/4 pct in the near future. But many economists feared that any moderate U.S. rate increases, which appear unlikely to be matched by rate cuts overseas, would be too little, too late. ""They should have done this 10 days ago. It would have done the trick then,"" said one currency analyst. ""If they do it now, it would be seen as a defensive measure not an offensive one. It would show policy weakness not strength,"" added one trader. In addition, economists fear that a discount rate rise might place additional strain on a sluggish U.S. economy and tempt embattled debtor nations to retaliate. A U.S. discount rate increase would also fuel the protectionist fires in Washington, where the House is expected to pass a protectionist trade bill, whatever compromises President Reagan and Prime Minister Nakasone can come up with during their summit later in the week. ""Politically, they can't really do it this week,"" said one currency analyst, pointing out that if it failed to stabilize the dollar, it would only weaken the U.S. negotiating stance. Even if the U.S. retains the upper hand, economists and traders do not hold out high hopes for any major new initiatives from this week's talks. At best, the experts see some sort of accord whereby Japan will agree to stimulate growth and open its domestic markets to outsiders while the U.S. promises to lift its tariffs and support the Group of Seven dollar stabilization agreement. But many fear that this may not be enough to assuage the market's speculative selling fervor, which has now raised fears of weak overseas interest at next week's quarterly U.S. Treasury refunding program. Japanese and European investors have traditionally played an active role in these auctions, which are expected to total 28 to 29 billion dlrs. Consequently, thoughts are turning to the possibility that President Reagan may try to remove foreign investors' worries about currency risk by financing part of the U.S. budget deficit in yen or mark bonds, rather than dollars. While similar action by former President Carter helped to stabilize the dollar in 1978, the White House is clearly reluctant to take such a step, economists said. This hesitance was amply shown last Friday when U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker said, ""there might well be some who would view (yen-denominated bonds) as a lack of confidence by the U.S. in its own currency."" Baker added, ""therefore we don't think it's an appropriate thing to do."" A foreign exchange analyst at a major Japanese bank here shared Baker's doubts. ""Dollar defending measures are very unlikely. They will confirm the dollar's weak undertone and lead to further speculative dollar selling,"" he said. Thus, it may be less destabilizing for the authorities to stop trying to fight the market's bearish sentiment. In a recent lengthy report, economists at Morgan Guaranty Trust Co concluded, ""the dollar should be left free to trade at whatever level market forces produce."" Reuter &#3;"

""What our current outlook suggests is that total world energy consumption will continue to grow steadily in an ever more energy efficient world,"" Rawl said. But, he added, Exxon projects that ""despite today's ample supplies, the world will also be facing up to inherent limitations on the availability of oil and gas, which currently supplies more than half of the world's energy needs.""

""The question is when and how this will happen,"" he said. ""I believe that synthetic projects will not only re-emerge but will become commercial well below those we were thinking about the last time oil prices moved substantially higher."" Rawl said synthetic fuel would become economic at lower prices because companies are investigating ""a new generation of ideas that promise substantially lower costs"" and projects begun in the late 1970s, which have since been suspended. Rawl also said companies must find new and more effective ways of enhanced recovery from existing oil fields. ""It would be my view that new oil discoveries, even with advanced technology, are likely to slow down - not reverse - the decline in worldwide oil discoveries,"" he said. ""So it is essential to find a better way to recover more of the discovered oil from producing fields using chemicals, solvents, heat, and other techniques."" Rawl emphasized that private oil companies need some assistance from government in developing synfuels technology. ""More importantly, they need to provide a political and economic environment that is stable enough to allow the developmental process to function effectively, he said.

""It also seems to me that if we are going to sell in world markets, we have to meet the price,"" he added. Shultz called proposals to broaden the eligibility criteria of USDA's export enhancement program (EEP) to include all U.S. customers ""questionable."" An across-the-board EEP would mark a ""considerable change"" in the current program, which Shultz said is designed ""to say to other countries that subsidize, particularly the European Common Market, that we're not going to give up our markets to those subsidized sales and we'll have a little kit bag that will meet that competition and hold our markets for our farmers."" ""If you just go across-the-board and subsidize everything, that's a different order of program and seems to me quite questionable,"" he said. Reuter &#3;"
PUBLISHED-TESTSET,['nat-gas'],"Blocking Canadian gas imports would not serve the long-term interests of the United States, said Martha Hesse, chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, adding that the development of a freely open North American energy market should be encouraged. ""I firmly believe that the long-term interest of U.S. consumers would not be served by any attempt to promote a 'Made in America' label for gas,"" she said at an oil and gas conference. She said the commission recognizes the important role Canadian gas plays in the American market, despite grumblings among U.S. domestic producers of the competition from north of the border. Recent figures show Canada shipped 2.48 billion Canadian dlrs worth of gas to the U.S. in 1986, down sharply from the 3.91 billion dlr total in 1985. ""But we do seriously recognize the importance in the years to come of the supplies of Canadian gas to U.S. markets,"" she said. ""And even in the short term, competition is generally a good thing,"" she added. She said the commission is concentrating on improving the access to U.S. pipelines, something that would be of great benefit to Canadian producers. Hesse said transportation of Canadian gas is already improving, gas imports rising more than 21 pct in the first two months of the year. But Hesse declined to comment in detail on the controversial December order, known as the ""as billed issue"", because it is the subject of a new hearing. The order, which is being fought by Canada, involves barring U.S. pipeline companies and consumers from paying certain Canadian shipping expenses. Hesse said the order was never intended ""as an attempt to extend the arm of U.S. regulations across the border."" However, a senior Canadian government energy official warned delegates the ruling could severely weaken Canadian gas producers. ""Besides the extra territorial effect, there is the potential that Canadian consumers and producers may end up subsidizing the cost of transportation services originally incurred on behalf of U.S. customers,"" said Robert Skinner, an assistant deputy minister in Canada's energy department.

PUBLISHED-TESTSET,"['carcass', 'livestock', 'orange']","The Reagan administration is expected to face tough resistance from Japan and from some entrenched U.S. interests, if it hopes to succeed in forcing Japan to end beef and citrus import controls by April, 1988, U.S. and Japanese officials said. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng and Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter took a hardline stance on beef and citrus in talks here last week, insisting that the quotas be abandoned by April, 1988. But that stance will be difficult to maintain because Japan will resist the pressure fiercely and because some U.S. suppliers of those commodities have an interest in maintaining the quotas, U.S. and Japanese officials told Reuters. Twice in the past, the United States has negotiated with Japan on beef and citrus import quotas -- during the Tokyo round of multilateral trade negotiations in 1978, and in bilateral talks in 1984. Each time the U.S. demanded an end to the quotas at the outset but ultimately accepted substantial increases instead. The current agreement calls for an increase in high quality beef imports to 58,400 tonnes in fiscal 1987, oranges to 126,000 tonnes and orange juice to 8,500 tonnes. Lyng has said repeatedly that this time the United States will not settle for simple increases in the quotas. Japan has been given plenty of time to reform its agricultural support system and the quotas must be scrapped, Lyng said. Japanese officials want to begin informal talks on beef and citrus in August or September in Hawaii, sources said. If the U.S. intends to press its tough stance, and Japan, as expected rejects the demands, the issue may then be put to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade for settlement, which would mean prolonging the friction beyond the April, 1988 deadline set by the U.S., officials said. In interviews here, Japanese officials insist that on beef they will not liberalize imports, regardless of the U.S. pressure, because the Japanese beef industry is not competitive and would be damaged by freer trade. Most Japanese beef production still tends to be on small farms which Japanese officials said must be protected from cheap imports by use of the quota system. Furthermore, while the U.S. National Cattlemen's Association is strongly supporting the tough administration position, some U.S. meat exporters and packers are ambivalent. This is because to some U.S. exporters and packers beef exports to Japan under the quota system are a steady, reliable business managed by a quasi-government Japan Livestock Industry Promotion Corporation. Under quotas the U.S. share of Japan's beef market has expanded at the expense of Australia. In the absence of quotas, some U.S. suppliers are concerned the U.S. share might decline and exporting to Japan would become a riskier business, meat industry sources said. Major U.S meat industry leaders will meet in Washington next week, including cattlemen, processors and exporters, in an effort to reach an industry-wide consensus toward Japan. The citrus industry also appears split on the quota issue. California's Sunkist, the largest U.S. supplier of oranges to Japan, has expressed reservations about eliminating quotas. A representative of Sunkist said the cooperative is concerned that in the absence of quotas, lower quality oranges from Israel and South Africa might be competitive in Japan. Ironically, some Japanese officials hinted that fresh oranges may be a product on which imports could be freed with a minimum of impact on Japanese mandarin orange production. This is because U.S. oranges do not directly compete with smaller Japanese mandarins, officials said. But Japan wants to maintain quotas on orange juice because it fears imported juice tastes better and would displace Japanese mandarin orange juice, they said. One scenario mentioned by both U.S. and Japanese officials is that Tokyo may try to blunt the tough administration stance by offering to scrap the quota on fresh oranges in return for U.S. acceptance of increases in beef and juice quotas. Lyng has acknowledged that liberalization of beef and citrus imports is a difficult objective, but he insisted during the week-long tour here that it is a high priority on the U.S./Japan agriculture agenda-- more important than the rice issue which received most of the attention. Asked about the ambivalence of some in U.S. agribusiness, Lyng noted some interests on both the U.S. and Japanese side have benefited from quotas but this will not stop the administration from pressing for liberalization. And Lyng said the administration believes it can marshall more support for eliminating the quotas now than ever before, because of concern about Japan's rising trade surplus. ""We're coming at this one (beef and citrus negotiation) with a much stronger view coming out of Washington. The times have changed. The trade balance is much worse,"" Lyng said. Reuter &#3;"
PUBLISHED-TESTSET,['crude'],"The sliding value of the U.S. dollar may soon force the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to raise its oil benchmark price, setting the stage for prices as high as 22 dlrs a barrel by yearend, top executives with U.S. oil companies said. The current benchmark price of 18 dlrs a barrel was established by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) at its December meeting when the cartel set a 15.8 mln barrel per day production ceiling. But the continuing weakness of the U.S. dollar, the currency used by OPEC for its oil sales, is making the 18 dlr price difficult to sustain, said Fred Hartley, chairman of Unocal Corp &lt;UCL>. The U.S. dollar has fallen in value by about 10 pct since December and has fallen by a total of about 40 pct during the past two years. Hartley told Reuters he expected significantly higher oil prices this winter and would not rule out the potential for 25 dlrs a barrel by the spring of 1988. ""I think June will be the critical month to see what they do,"" said Hartley, who was in Houston to attend the World Petroleum Congress. OPEC has scheduled a regular meeting in June which some experts believe is likely to revive suggestions that oil should be priced according to a basket of world currencies instead of the U.S. dollar. E.H. Clark, chairman of &lt;Baker Hughes Inc>, said the Saudi kingdom's need to generate revenues -- rather than greater world demand -- would drive any price increases. ""The Saudis have made committments and have a balance of trade based on receiving 18 dlrs a barrel for this oil. But the U.S. dollar won't buy as much as it did five or six months ago,"" Clark said in an interview. ""I'm betting on the Saudi king's need to sustain revenues."" Clark predicted that world oil prices would top 22 dlrs a barrel by January one. However, the authoritative Middle East Economic Survey reported yesterday that Saudi Arabia would not seek to increase OPEC oil prices unless oil demand showed strong growth. Saudi sources told the newsletter that the policy was based on the longterm need to restore the competitive position of OPEC oil against other energy sources. Many oil industry experts are forecasting a modest increase in world oil demand averaging one pct annually during the next few years. Michel Moreau, a director of the &lt;Elf Aquitaine Group>, said he believed the worldwide oil industry had reached a consensus that prices of at least 20 dlrs a barrel were necessary to cover exploration costs, royalties and taxes on new production. The 20 dlr level will be reached this year only if the cash-strapped nations of Nigeria, Egypt and Gabon refrain from discounting oil prices or increasing production levels, Moreau said. ""I think if more than two (OPEC nations) defect, the production agreement will fall apart,"" he said. ""But this threat is the Saudis' big stick to keep producers in line. Nobody wants a repeat of the collapse that occurred in 1986."" Lawrence Rawl, chairman of Exxon Corp &lt;XON>, told Reuters he expected prices would remain at 18 dlrs through the end of 1987, adding that 20 dlrs a barrel was a possibility. Other major companies are taking a more cautious view of prices, fearing that some OPEC members may yet upset the cartel's production agreement. ""This is a year of testing,"" said Alfred Munk, manager of foreign affairs at Amoco Corp. (AN). ""If they fail, there may be a price decline to about 14 dlrs a barrel."" French-owned Total CFP's vice president Pierre Vaillaud said, ""Demand is not going up very quickly, at best maybe one percent a year. You can't change the price with just one pct,"" Vaillaud said.

PUBLISHED-TESTSET,"['dlr', 'money-fx']","The prospect of renewed assaults on the dollar might force the United States eventually to unveil distasteful measures to bolster support for its currency, monetary analysts and economists said. Treasury Secretary James Baker has acknowledged that the Reagan administration discussed the possibility of issuing yen-denominated U.S. government bonds to support the dollar. But he has also dismissed speculation that he was ready to take such an unusual step. Nonetheless, monetary sources say the issue has been seriously discussed by the administration. ""It is unlikely that we would undertake to do that now,"" Baker said last week. ""In our view there might well be some who would view (issuing U.S. yen bonds) as, in fact, a lack of confidence by the U.S. in its own currency. And therefore we don't think it's an appropriate thing to do."" But if the Reagan administration did announce measures, they could be a part of an internationally-coordinated effort to end the instability in financial markets with genuine action to reduce massive economic imbalances, monetary analysts believe. And, like a currency defense package unveiled by the Carter administration, issuing yen bonds could be accompanied by a rise in the discount rate, now 5.5 pct. The Federal Reserve has resisted pressure to raise this key rate so far, chiefly, some Fed officials say, because it could hurt economic growth. Another concern is the fragile international debt situation. Analysts who expect a currency support package are divided over its possible timing. Some even believe an announcement could come this week during a visit to Washington by Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone. ""It would give some real focus to the visit, and it might steady the dollar and prevent it from going down,"" said Charles Taylor, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities. But monetary sources said they thought it unlikely that the Reagan administration would resort to measures which would bring to mind the troubles of President Carter. Until very recently, the current administration has urged a lower dollar to help redress its huge trade deficit while Carter faced a weak dollar as confidence in his economic policies collapsed. But today, Washington's policies are increasingly in question. The Carter plan was unleashed on Nov. 1, 1978. And it was a resounding success. ""This package really gave credibility to the administration to get the dollar up,"" said Robert Hormats, vice-president of Goldman Sachs Inc and a former senior U.S. economic in the Carter and Reagan Administrations. The dollar then stood at just under 1.87 marks and around 188 yen. Today it stands around 1.79 marks and 139 yen. ""The problem is now that the administration in rhetoric is evidencing concern about the dollar but in practice is really doing very little,"" Hormats said of statements to support the dollar by U.S. officials. Several currency traders and foreign central bank officials think these statements still fall short of unequivocally saying the dollar has declined far enough. Carter issued 6.4 billion dlrs of mark and swiss franc bonds aimed essentially at buttressing pyschological support for the dollar but also at attracting foreign investors, who had lost confidence in the dollar, to U.S. government notes. The package was supported by a one pct rise in the discount rate, to 9.5 pct, drawings on U.S. monetary reserves at the International Monetary Fund and sales of U.S.-held SDRS to other IMF members. It was also supported by increased Fed currency swap lines with other central banks and stepped up official U.S. gold sales. Stephen Axilrod, a former Fed official who is now vice-chairman of Nikko Securities, said, ""I think it's very unlikely they would do that now."" He argued that it was politically difficult to take action to support the dollar while Japan and West Germany have still to fulfill pledges to stimulate their economies. But most analysts believe a currency support package would only work if genuine economic measures to redress world trade imbalances are undertaken by the leading industrial powers. It could coincide with the June Venice summit of leaders of the seven major industrial democracies -- the United States, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada. Hormats said he believed the currency has to decline slightly further for a package to have impact. He said the seven nations' Paris Accord to stabilize currencies was forged too soon to fundamentally change market sentiment. ""I think we're nearing a point when they would feel (politically) comfortable doing this,"" Hormats said. Many analysts think the administration's reluctance to act firmly on the dollar has been due to its desire to keep up the pressure on its allies to bolster their economies and for fear of fanning protectionist sentiment in Congress. But Hormats said ""there will be a point at which the government of the United States shows it does give a damn for the dollar."" Reuter &#3;"

PUBLISHED-TESTSET,['crude'],"The offshore oil drilling industry will attract increasing numbers of government connected firms in the 1990s, according to Ronald Tappmeyer, Vice Chairman of Reading and Bates Drilling Co. Tappmeyer told the Offshore Technology Conference that contract drilling was reaching the same kind of situation that oil producing companies reached when their oilfields were nationalized in nations as Venezuela, Iran and Saudi Arabia. He said local connections to the nation whose waters are being drilled was an increasingly important factor in the market. ""We have seen contractors put at competitive disadvantages in nations in which they had worked successfully for years essentially moved aside to make room for locally-owned firms or a locally-built rig,"" he said. Tappmeyer, who is president of the International Association of Drilling Contractors, said how far the trend would spread depends on the growth of trade protectionism. He added that international contractors will increasingly find their role restricted to regions that require special expertise and experience, such as wildcat areas and severe environments such as in the Arctic and extremely deep waters. Tappmeyer also said he expects producing companies to provide the main financing for offshore drilling in the coming decade as banks will be unwilling to repeat overexposing themselves and drilling contractors will have difficulty providing financing out of cash flow. At the same time, he said he saw the financing as indirect as he does not see producers getting back in the rig-owning business. He also said projectfinancing will have to be backed up by work commitments to guarantee the payoff of construction costs. For the time being, he said there was a superabundance of rigs. But he said there will be a need for new, technologically advanced rigs within a few years. He said the floating-drilling rigs were most likely to benefit from new developments in technology, adding that by 2,000 there should not be an ocean left that is too deep, too cold, too stormy or too remote to be explored.

PUBLISHED-TESTSET,"['grain', 'oilseed']","European Community (EC) leaders hope to make a new attempt to inject fresh urgency into talks on reforming the bloc's controversial farm policy when EC agriculture ministers meet for a third day of discussions here this morning. Community officials said farm commissioner Frans Andriessen met Belgian minister Paul de Keersmaeker late last night to plan a new initiative. Both Andriessen and de Keersmaeker, who currently chairs EC farm ministers' meetings, were said to be disappointed by the lack of progress in the talks so far this week. The bloc's executive Commission has proposed a tough package involving effective cuts of upwards of 10 pct in farmers' returns for many crops this year. Ministers were due to have adopted a package by April 1 but are only this week getting down to serious negotiations. Yesterday, they discussed plans to cut cereals prices by 2.5 pct, and reduce farmers' rights to sell surpluses to EC stores, to cut prices for fruit and vegetables by larger margins, and to impose a tax on EC-produced and imported oilseeds, a proposal which would be likely to sour EC trade relations with the United States. Diplomatic sources said ministers, all of whom are opposed to at least one of these propositions, maintained entrenched positions yesterday, making the task of de Keersmaeker in steering his colleagues towards a compromise a daunting one. They said he could also be treading a minefield if he sought to breach the divide between his fellow ministers over plans to change the system by which EC farm prices, expressed in a notional common currency, are translated into the currencies of member states. West German minister Ignaz Kiechle indicated yesterday he would veto the adoption of Commission proposals in this area, saying they would unfairly affect farmers in strong currency nations. The Belgian sources said de Keersmaeker may today present a paper to his colleagues which, while not having the status of a compromise proposal, would attempt to narrow their options. But diplomats said the philosophical gap between ministers like Kiechle, with his commitment to maintaining traditional rural patterns, and others who see runaway farm spending as unacceptable economically, is likely to prove extremely difficult to bridge. They agreed with EC farmers' union association president Hans Kjeldsen who said yesterday that an agreement in June appeared to be the best that could be hoped for. Reuter &#3;"

""Currencies are likely to muddle around these levels,"" said Shearson Lehman Brothers analyst Anne Parker Mills. Traders are unwilling to establish either long or short positions in futures because of uncertainty over upcoming trade talks and U.S. trade legislation, they said. Japanese prime minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and President Reagan will meet Thursday and Friday to discuss trade tensions between their two countries, while at the same time the Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives will be voting on a controversial trade bill. ""Unless something really surprising comes out of the Nakasone/Reagan talks, I don't see the dollar getting above 142 (yen) and 1.83 (marks),"" Mills said. The equivalent in futures of those interbank levels are about 0.007050 to 0.007025 in the June yen contract and about 0.5500 in June marks, she said. June yen closed at 0.007191 on Tuesday while June marks finished the day at 0.5602. Mills said, however, that ""the chances of them (Reagan and Nakasone) coming up with something new are limited."" One possibility might be a Japanese discount rate cut, but ""they probably won't do that unless we raise our discount rate."" Recent firmness in the federal funds rate and the Federal Reserve's slowness in adding reserves to the banking system has heightened sentiment that the money-policy making body has already tightened credit and a discount rate hike is possible, analysts said. Recent weakness in currencies and strength in the dollar has been more the result of nervous shortcovering ahead of the meeting rather than reaction to the White House statement Monday supporting a stable dollar, said Harris bank currency analyst Earl Johnson. Traders ""are worried about the outcome of the talks between Reagan and Nakasone,"" and as the talks are late in the week, the market may not get a chance to react to any developments until Monday, Johnson said. Until then, Johnson expects the dollar to remain in a broad range between 1.77 and 1.85 marks and 137 to 140.50 yen. Chicago Corp analyst John Bilson, however, expects a rally in the European currencies over the near-term, while the yen, at this point is overbought. ""The Japanese are moving away from the U.S. market,"" and investment funds formerly directed to the U.S. are likely to flow into Europe, Bilson said. The chief beneficiary of such a flow of funds will be sterling, Bilson said. ""Sterling rates are about four pct above Japanese rates, despite the half point rate cut,"" Bilson said. Major U.K. banks lowered their base lending rates today to 9.5 pct. In addition to a favorable interest rate spread which should attract funds, Bilson said the firm oil market and the strong political situation of Prime Minister Thatcher also make British investments attractive. Passage of the trade bill, which includes an amendment by Missouri Democrat Richard Gephardt that would force a 10 pct annual cut in imports from countries with an excessive trade surplus with the U.S. if they fail to remove unfair trade barriers to the U.S. after six months of negatiations, would likely pressure the yen, Bilson said. Bilson, however, said the legislation is unlikely to pass, but that Nakasone is likely to bring a promise to open Japanese markets to U.S. goods and back it up with government contracts with U.S. manufacturers.

Vladmir Vladiminovich Semenovich, the head of petroleum geology at Moscow State University, told delegates at the World Petroleum Congress that exploration efficiency could also be improved through new and more sophisticated technology. ""We should emphasize that when having the data about petroleum distribution onshore and offshore, it is possible to clarify the idea of global regularities in oil and gas prospects,"" Semenovich said. ""However, much work should be done to coordinate data concerning the structure and oil and gas prospects in adjoining onshore and offshore basins."" Sharing the information could help geologists better predict regional trends and underground formations that indicate the presence of oil or gas, he said. Semenovich also said that existing estimates of the potential oil and natural gas resources of the world may need to be revised upward as oil companies continue to examine unexplored regions. The world, which has already produced 476 billion barrels of oil and gas, has a current total of about 733 billion barrels in proved reserves. Undiscovered resources are estimated at about 1.4 trillion barrels, or about half of the total ultimate reserves, Semenovich said. ""There are a lot of unstudied regions all over the world and, as far as the already known basins, one continues to find additional reserves,"" he said, noting that Antarctica has been virtually ignored. ""The existing estimate of potential resources of the world may need to be enlarged."" To find deeper and more expensive reserves, scientists will need to use 3-D mapping of underground formations and laser spectrometry to measure bitumen in soils and plants among other techniques, he said. He estimated that continental slopes contain about 10 to 13 pct of all offshore reserves. Semenovich also said that virtually all of the total oil and gas resources now estimated to exist in the world would be discovered and placed in production during the next 50 years. After his speech, Semenovich told Reuters that Soviet oil production was increasing. ""The difficulties of 1985 have been overcome and we're now back to normal production,"" he said. The Soviet Union, the world's largest producer of oil, had experienced drilling and technical problems that cut total liquids production from 12.45 mln barrels a day in 1984 to 12.1 mln barrels a day in 1985. Last year, the Soviets produced an estimated 12.3 mln barrels. When asked about the recent reopening and testing of a coal gasification project in Soviet Central Asia, Semenovich said the project was important because of the lack of oil reserves in the region. Semenovich declined to identify at what level of world oil prices the coal gasification process would become economic again. ""It's too expensive for the time being,"" Semenovich said. ""Theoretical development is underway and tests are being run. For the moment, coal gasification is a very small part of the energy industry,"" he said. Reuter &#3;"

The reserves, up from 54 billion dlrs on April 19, compare with 27.3 billion a year ago, the Central Bank said. Vice economic minister Wang Chien-shien told Reuters: ""The rising reserves will certainly intensify our trade friction with the U.S."" A central bank official, who declined to be named, said Taiwan's trade surplus is expected to exceed 5.5 billion U.S. Dlrs in the first four months of 1987, against 4.25 billion a year ago. The influx of speculative funds, mainly from Hong Kong, Japan and the U.S., Also played a major role behind the rise of the reserves, he said, but declined to give figures. Banking sources said almost 10 billion U.S. Dlrs had entered Taiwan since early 1986. About three billion of the funds were remitted through different channels, including the black market, since the start of this year, they said. Wang Chao-ming, vice chairman of the government's Council for Economic Planning and Development, said he expects the reserves to rise in the next few months because of the continuing high level of Taiwan's exports and the steady appreciation of the local dollar against the U.S. Currency. ""The latest government moves to open (the domestic) market, cut import tariffs and lift foreign exchange controls have achieved little success,"" he said. Vice economic minister Li Mo said tariffs were cut on some 1,700 products in January and a further 862 this month in a bid to encourage more imports, especially the U.S. More tariff cuts on about 300 imported products, including televisions, video tape recorders, cosmetics and refrigerators will be announced in a month or two, Li said.

The Office said the March trade surplus had also risen strongly from the year-ago month total of 8.5 billion marks, while the March current account surplus compared with only 4.3 billion marks a year earlier. The figures given by the office show nominal trade flows, but an office statement said that the current account surplus had also risen in real terms from February. However, it attributed this partly to the fact that payments to the European Community had been brought forward in February, with the result that transfers abroad in March were unusually low. The Statistics Office said March imports totalled 36.93 billion marks, a rise of 15 pct from February and of 4.7 pct compared with March 1986. March exports of 47.06 billion marks were 11 pct higher than in February and 7.6 pct higher than in March last year. Other data reported in the current account balance showed there was a 400 mln mark deficit in supplementary trade items, a 500 mln mark deficit in the services account and a 400 mln mark deficit in transfer payments. The Statistics Office said that in the first three months of this year the trade surplus had risen to 27.8 billion marks from 22.6 billion marks in the same period last year.

PUBLISHED-TESTSET,"['oilseed', 'grain', 'veg-oil']","European Community (EC) agriculture ministers ended a three-day meeting in Luxembourg still deeply divided over plans by the EC Commission to curb the cost of the EC's farm policy through sharp cuts in farm returns. Their chairman, Belgium's Paul de Keersmaeker, told a news conference after the meeting he would work on a paper setting out possible compromise solutions in the next two weeks, with the hope that the ministers can get down to detailed negotiations at a meeting in Brussels on May 18. But diplomats said the talks this week had served little more than to clarify member states' positions on the complex package of measures proposed by the commission. The executive body has proposed measures which would result in price cuts this year for many crops of upwards of 10 pct. Other controversial plans include a tax on EC-produced and imported oilseeds and fats to bring in two billion European currency units, to help the EC's cash crisis, and changes in the conversion of EC common farm prices into national currencies which would inflict extra burdens on West German and Dutch farmers. De Keersmaeker attempted yesterday to narrow differences between EC states on the oils tax proposal, the currency measures and the key question of cereals prices and associated measures. But he told journalists, ""We have used this meeting to reach the point at which real negotiations can start at the next meeting. Ideally they should have started now but our procedures took much longer than planned."" Ministers are in theory supposed to agree a price package by April 1 each year, although this target is seldom reached in practice. Diplomats said on all the points there were widely diverging views, with Britain and the Netherlands, the countries most supportive of commission proposals for cereals price cuts, strongly opposed to the oils tax. However, de Keersmaeker said West German objections to the monetary proposals could prove the most difficult issue to resolve. ""This is a very tough political nut, and because of the very nature of the problem there is no technical solution,"" he said. Commission sources said farm commissioner Frans Andriessen was prepared to alter some technical aspects of his proposals to make an agreement easier. However, because of the EC's budgetary crisis, he had little room for concessions to pleas for a cut in the impact of his proposals on farmers' incomes as several ministers, led by Germany's Ignaz Kiechle, are demanding. EC Commission president Jacques Delors has warned that the EC will have an accumulated budgetary deficit of over five billion Ecus by the end of this year, even if the commission farm price package is adopted in its entirety.

PUBLISHED-TESTSET,"['money-fx', 'sfr', 'money-supply']","The Swiss National Bank is prepared to increase its intervention on currency markets if the action can be properly coordinated with other central banks, Markus Lusser, a member of the Bank's three man directorate, said. He told a meeting of Swiss industrialists that intervention to support the dollar could not bring about lasting changes in exchange rates unless accompanied by fundamental changes in economic policy. However, intervention could send signals that would contribute to a short term smoothing of currency movements. The National Bank was prepared to intensify cooperation with other central banks, especially where convincing coordination and significant timing are guaranteed, Lusser said. He said currency developments could not simply be talked into existence but needed to be matched by actions in the field of economic policy. ""Put simply, that means that in order to stabilise the dollar in a lasting way, a reduction of the budget deficit and a slowdown in money supply growth in the United States are unavoidable,"" he said. The National Bank has intervened in dollar-yen repeatedly in the last few weeks and earlier this week it said it had intervened in dollar-Swiss franc for the first time since last October. Lusser said the key to increased exchange rate stability lay not in currency intervention by central banks but only in an improvement in international economic policy coordination. This meant that industrial countries must avoid abrupt switches in economic policy and give priority to price stability. Lusser said the National Bank continued to take the view that easing its strict monetary policies would be incompatible with its primary goal of combatting inflation. The bank target is for growth of two pct in central bank money supply in 1987.

PUBLISHED-TESTSET,"['money-fx', 'dmk', 'interest']","Speculation abroad that the Bundesbank will steer money market rates lower, opening the for interest rate cuts around Europe, is not shared by many economists and money market dealers within Germany. Speculation has developed that the Bundesbank would engineer lower rates to take pressure off the dollar/mark. A strong rise in U.S. Market rates this month, prompting speculation the Fed would raise its 5-1/2 pct discount rate, has raised the question whether Germany and Japan would also broaden interest rate differentials to support the dollar. The U.S.-Japanese trade dispute is the key to the interest rate outlook, money market dealers in Paris said. Talks this week between Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and President Reagan, if successful, could take pressure off the dollar, dealers and economists said. Short term interest rates would be likely to ease if the trade dispute is solved and the dollar steadies, they said. But if no solution is found, the Paris dealers said, a renewed dollar fall would put strains on the mark/French franc rate and force the Bank of France to raise short-term rates. The three-month U.S. Treasury bill rate rose to six pct this week from 5.6 pct at the start of April, and the yield on the 30-year benchmark treasury bonds rose this week in Tokyo to a 14-month high of 8.86 pct from 7.66 pct in late March. The dollar stabilized today just below 1.80 marks and above 140 yen, underpinned by higher U.S. Rates and the Fed discount rate speculation. But most dealers expect it to weaken further, which would put pressure on the Bundesbank to ease interest rates. Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said yesterday the U.S. Had requested Japan to cut short-term interest rates. The Bank of Japan was making efforts to do this, he said, adding the U.S. Had not asked for a cut in Japan's 2.5 pct discount rate, a move which Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita said was not under consideration. A call for a German move came yesterday from Dutch central bank president Wim Duisenberg, who said the Dutch central bank favoured a cut in West German interest rates and would follow suit if it happened. Citibank AG said in its April report that another expected phase of dollar weakness would prompt the Bundesbank to cut key money market rates in the next three to six months. The Bundesbank has set a fixed rate of 3.80 pct on repurchase pacts since February, with call money trading around 3.70 pct for much of April. Phillips and Drew senior European economist Richard Reid said the Bundesbank would allow interest rates to ease further, either with a lower fixed rate tender, or a tender by interest rate, allowing the market to set the rate. ""I'm fairly confident we'll see lower rates,"" he said. Reid said taking 30 basis points off the repurchase rate would have little impact on the German economy or fundamental exchange rates, but could change market currency perceptions. ""A cut in German rates wouldn't be bad for the dollar, but I think its effect would be limited in duration unless it was accompanied by other measures elsewhere,"" he said. Money market dealers here noted the speculation abroad that the Bundesbank would push down repurchase rates, but said the Bundesbank had little reason to cut rates further at the moment, despite the liquid market seen for most of this month. The dealers said the Bundesbank was likely to move to an interest rate tender for its repurchase pacts next month. That should not be seen as a sign of easing monetary policy however, they said. The Bundesbank would merely be experimenting with interest rate tenders, following the introduction of a new system to speed up the tender process at the start of April, they said. Reinhard Pohl, head of the monetary policy section at the DIW economic research institute in West Berlin, said the Bundesbank would probably not cut rates on repurchase pacts. ""I don't think that if they cut the repurchase rate a little it would stop a wave of (currency) speculation,"" he said. But a sharp and sudden deterioration in the dollar could force the Bundesbank to take some action, he said. Pohl said the Bundesbank was concerned that a cut in interest rates would accelerate excessive monetary growth. Some Bundesbank officials have argued recently that the monetary overshoot was due to strong currency inflows rather than credit growth, and therefore a more appropriate response to excessive money supply growth would be to cut rates, to make the mark and mark investments less attractive. Pohl said the Bundesbank was hoping that domestic investors would switch funds parked in liquid short-term accounts, which have swollen central bank money stock, into securities, which would take them out of the Bundesbank's key monetary measure. A cut in interest rates at this stage however would lead investors to assume that rates had bottomed out and the next move would be upwards. They would therefore hold off buying bonds, leaving central bank money stock swollen. There are so far no signs that German investors are switching funds into long term securities as the Bundesbank hopes they will, Berliner Handels- und Frankfurter Bank economist Hermann Remsperger said. But Phillips and Drew's Reid said prospects of lower rates and a strong currency would attract foreign investors into German bonds, which would in turn attract domestic investors. Werner Rein, chief economist at Union Bank of Switzerland in Zurich, said he thought it likely that interest rates would continue to drift lower in many European countries. ""The scope for lower rates is probably greatest in Britain but more limited in West Germany, where we could see some consolidation,"" he said. Switzerland could be forced to match any cut in German rates to prevent the franc rising further against the mark, he said. Currency dealers in London said another half-point cut in U.K. Bank base rates was likely in the next few weeks as the pound had shrugged off yesterday's cuts and was still rising. REUTER &#3;"

""Estimated potential world reserves of extra heavy oils exceed 500 billion barrels, of which more than half are located in Venezuela,"" Juan Chacin Guzman, President of Petroleos de Venezuela told the World Petroleum Congress. ""And this virtually unused resource represents a prime example of the need to invest in technology to ensure tomorrow's energy future,"" he added. Venezuela had to reduce heavy crude oil output in favor of light oils because of economics and a very limited market. Not many refineries have been upgraded to process the heavy oils. ""Improved technology has the potential for reducing the capital investment and operating costs of typical heavy oil development projects by 30 pct or more,"" Gordon Willmon, VP and general manager, oil sands and coal department, Esso Resources Canada Ltd said at the World Petroleum Congress. Crude oil prices fell under 10 dlrs dlrs a barrel last summer as OPEC members increased production to gain market share, but have since risen to around 18 dlrs because the  OPEC production/pricing agreement is basically in tact. Willmon said light and medium crude oils currently supply 90 pct of world oil demand yet they account for less than 25 pct of remaining petroleum resources. ""So future demand increasingly will be met from the various forms of heavy oil,"" Willmon said. Heavy crude oil resources include extra-heavy oil/tar sand, natural bituminous sands and oil shales (in sedimentary rock). Willmon cited major factors that will make heavy oil development economical, including real and stable growth in crude oil prices, favorable fiscal terms, and improved technology. He said he expects ""all pieces of the puzzle to fit together."" But he cautioned that the short-term outlook is very sensitive to crude oil prices. And he said the most important factor in development of heavy oils is the recovery of the price of crude. Willmon said the price of light crude must be about eight dlrs higher than heavy crude before there is an incentive for an oil company to upgrade its refinery to process heavy oil. He said the current price differential is only about five dlrs a barrel. Willmon indicated that a benchmark crude oil price above 20 dlrs would be ideal. But he said currently under study are a broad range of high potential cost-effective technologies for resources recovery, transportation and upgrading of heavy oils, which would permit commercial development despite a lower crude oil price outlook. Willmon said these technologies included enhanced recovery by steam injection and oil-and-water emulsion to reduce the viscocity of the heavy oils so they can flow easily through a pipeline. He said such technologies may substantially reduce current captial investment and operating costs. But he emphasized that innovative technology alone may not encourage new investment, that oil prices need to show a meaningful and sustained recovery. Most of the expenses associated with heavy oils production is fixed operating costs as in an oil sands project, rather than in exploration, according to Robert Smith, Senior VP Operations &lt;Syncrude Canada Ltd>. While exploration costs for conventional crude oil range from four to nine dlrs a barrel, discovery costs for synthetic crude from oil sands are nearly zero because the location and nature of the deposit are known, according to Smith. But the remote location of oil sands deposits mean that everything required to build and operate the plant must come from outside the area. Willmon also said, ""Public policy could best help by providing financial support to offset the high cost of technology developmemt which would help generate projects that could survive even at low oil prices for extended periods of time."" U.S. Energy Secretary John Herrington said, ""The Reagan Administration is firmly committed, without equivocation, to continuing our efforts to improve conditions and incentives in the marketplace that will spur oil and gas exploration and development.""

The energy price increases were the first visible measures taken in return for IMF standby credits and World Bank loans. Effective today, fuel oil prices were trebled and prices of gas oil, diesel and kerosene went up by over 50 pct, an Egyptian General Petroleum Corp (EGPC) official said. He said fuel oil will sell for 28 Egyptian pounds a ton, instead of 7.5 pounds. Kerosene and gas oil were raised by 66 pct to sell for five piasters a litre, while diesel rose 50 pct to 4.5 piasters. The government is expected also to act soon, possibly as early as next weekend, to simplify the country's complex exchange rate system, bankers said. Moving towards a more realistic exchange rate for the pound was part of a package of reforms sought by the IMF and creditor governments. In return, Egypt stands to receive up to one billion dlrs in IMF standby credits phased over three years to help it repay its 38.6 billion dlr foreign debt and guarantee rescheduling by western governments, the main creditors. Energy price increases were also a condition of progress on World Bank project loans of up to 800 mln dlrs in energy, communications and other sectors which have been under negotiation for several months, western diplomats said. The U.S. And Western Europe have pledged political backing for President Hosni Mubarak's government, committed to a multi-party political system and peace with Israel and strategically poised in control of the Suez Canal. Fuel price rises, postponed at least once and likely to lead to higher retail prices of basic goods, were a test of the government's resolve to pursue economic reform, diplomats said. But the new prices are still below world market levels. There was no announcement of increases in more politically sensitive products such as gasoline or natural gas, used for cooking, and the mass-circulation Al-Akhbar newspaper said they would stay the same. Official comment was not available on speculation among bankers and diplomats that the Central Bank would soon tinker with the pound's exchange rates to try to channel more dollars into the banking system away from the illegal but tolerated free market. The Central Bank was expected to set up a committee in which 10 commercial banks, including the four state-owned banks, would decide the pound's value every day. The official ""incentive rate,"" currently set by the Central Bank daily, is around 1.36 pounds to the dollar, against 2.15 on the free market. Bankers predicted that the banks' committee might set rates around 1.80 or 1.90. But some doubted this would serve the aim of curbing the free market. REUTER &#3;"
PUBLISHED-TESTSET,['nat-gas'],"Better times for the hard hit natural gas industry remains two to three years away as a seemingly intractable supply bubble continues to depress sales and prices, industry officials said. An uncertain regulatory environment, disputes over Canadian pricing policies and unusually warm winters are working against a quick recovery in the sector, a number of corporate and government speakers told an energy conference here. ""We see a tough, tough short-term market, both as to price and volume,"" said Michael Phelps, vice president of &lt;Westcoast Transmission Co Ltd>, a major Canadian natural gas carrier. But Phelps predicted a fall in U.S. supply -- caused by a sharp drop in exploration -- and a slight demand increase should help to burn off the excess supply by 1990. As a result, Canadian gas exports to the U.S. market should rise to up to 1.5 trillion cubic feet a year by the end of the decade, nearly double 1986's total. The health of the Canadian industry is heavily dependent on the U.S. market where nearly one third of Canada's gas production is sent. Cuba Wadlington, a vice president at Northwest Pipeline Corp of Salt Lake City, shared the view that markets could be in balance by 1990. He said while North American demand for natural gas has flattened at about 18 trillion cubic feet a year, a return to more colder winters in the next few years could quickly tighten supplies. ""Things are clearly working towards a shrinking of the bubble,"" Wadlington told Reuters in an interview. However, recent decisions by the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) were sharply criticized by Canadian delegates who suggested the moves could prevent the country from participating in the market's recovery. The key dispute, known as the as billed issue, involves a ruling last December by FERC which effectively bars U.S. pipeline companies and consumers from paying certain Canadian shipping expenses. The Canadian government believes the ruling could severely weaken the country's gas producers. ""Besides the extra-territorial effect, there is the potential that Conadian producers and consumers may end up subsidizing the cost of transportation services originally incurred on behalf of U.S. customers,"" said Robert Skinner, an assistant deputy minister in Canada's energy department. But FERC Chairman Martha Hesse told the conference the ruling was really intended ""to assure equal, fair and open competition in the pricing of natural gas sold within our country -- whatever the source of the gas."" Hesse maintained Canadian gas was crucial to the emergence of a freely competitive, continent-wide, energy market. Speaking to concerns in Canada that the U.S. is seeking to limit Canadian gas shipments, Hesse said such a move would work against the long-term interest of American consumers.

PUBLISHED-TESTSET,"['crude', 'nat-gas']","Offshore drilling for oil and gas will be moving into deeper and deeper waters, according to Ronald L. Geer, a consultant with Shell Oil Co. and president of the Marine Technology Society. Geer told a press conference at the Offshore Technology Conference that the technology existed to drill exploratory wells in up to 10,000 feet of water. But he added that as the industry moves more and more to floating systems as opposed to fixed bottom supported structures, the financial risks involved were greater. He said such projects involved six to nine year time frames, and there was a ""reluctance for people to stick their necks too far out."" Shell holds the world record for the deepest exploratory well, at 6,900 feet, in the Wilmington Canyon in the Atlantic offshore New Jersey in 1984. The company is currently drilling a 6,700 foot well in the Atwater Valley in the Gulf of Mexico offshore Louisiana. Meanwhile, Brazil's Petrobras set a world record for underwater production when they brought a well in 1,350 feet of water offshore Rio de Janeiro state into production in January. Geer said the industry was particularly interested in the Green Canyon field offshore Louisiana where a number of companies, including Shell, a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell &lt;RD>, Dupont Co's &lt;DD> Conoco Inc, USX Corp's &lt;X> Marathon Oil Co, Standard Oil Co &lt;SRD> and &lt;Placid Oil Co>, are working, many of them testing new deep-water technologies. Of particular interest is the controversial Penrod-72 system being operated by the Dallas-based Hunt brothers who last year placed Placid Oil under bankruptcy court protection in order to avoid foreclosures on its valuable oil properties. They have been seeking the right to use assets to drill oil wells in the Green Canyon through Penrod, arguing that continued development of the project is essential to their ability to get out of their financial crisis. Earlier this month, the Hunts were granted permission by a bankruptcy court to pursue the Green Canyon project. The Penrod system involves a controversial floating production platform with well heads sitting 1,350 feet down on the ocean floor. Some 24 wells will be attached to the wellhead, with one satellite well sitting in a record 1,700 feet of water. Geer said he could not comment on the Penrod project, other than to note that it involves so many new technologies, it might have a problem fitting all the pieces together within a specific time frame. He also said he believed the potential production from the project could be in line with what the Hunt Brothers have projected . The Hunts' creditor banks have contended the Hunts have exaggerated the potential of the project. ""They're in the ballpark,"" he said, of the numbers, adding that he did not have enough information to comment further. Reuter &#3;"
PUBLISHED-TESTSET,['nat-gas'],"Demand for natural gas has failed to grow in proportion to the decline in oil deliveries because of concerns over unresolved regulatory issues in the United States, said industry analysts and gas utility company sources. ""Natural gas is not free to compete,"" said Larry Makovich, director of utilities service at Data Resources Inc, ""problems on pipeline open access and take-or-pay liabilities still weigh heavily on end-users' decision to switch to natural gas."" A manager with an East Coast gas distribution company, agreed that reluctance among end-users often stemmed from fear of unresolved regulatory issues. ""The fact that at the federal level open access is not yet firmly in place threatens to impede free flow of natural gas from producers to consumers,"" he said. Michael German, an economist with the American Gas Association, said while a significant amount of gas was now replacing oil in dual-fuel boilers, the progress of expanding the marketshare of gas was slow. First quarter natural gas consumption data is not available until June. In the first three months of 1987, residual fuel demand fell by an average of 55,000 barrels per day, according to the American Petroleum Institute. Natural gas, however, was not able to take full advantage of the decline in oil consumption. AGA's German said that while industrial consumers were concerned with regulatory issues in their long-range capital investment decisions, in the dual-fuel boiler market relied on spot purchases. ""With all the capability of switching (from oil to natural gas) already there, price of the fuel is the only concern,"" he said, adding that compared with the same period last year, January natural gas price at burner tip is 16 pct lower for industrial users and 32 pct lower for utilities. German attributed the sluggish performance of natural gas to lower demand in the utility sector as a whole. ""March was warmer than normal, which cut down gas consumption not only in home heating but also in electricity generation,"" he said. In March, according to API monthly statistics, residual fuel deliveries fell by 13.6 pct to 1.2 mln barrels per day from the same period a year ago. While API specifically mentioned lower natural gas prices had put residual fuel at a price disadvantage among electric utilities and industrial users, industry analysts believed the role of natural gas was over-stated. Makovich of DRI noted much of the decline in oil in the fuel mix was taken up by new nuclear capacity coming on stream in the last few years. Nuclear capacity rose nine pct in 1986, and he projected the same rate of growth for 1987 and 11 pct growth in 1988. In contrast, oil and gas together represented only 15 pct of the fuel mix in 1986 and should decline to 13 pct by 1989, he said. Within this sector, gas share fell to 66 pct in 1986 from 76 pct a year ago due to competition from falling oil prices, he added. But this year, gas was expected to recapture only two pct of the share, Makovich said. Michael German of AGA agreed and said, ""Nevertheless, outlet for several hundred billion cubic feet of gas a year is significant in a glutted market."" Reuter &#3;"

""We have to secure the stability of oil for Japan,"" Kasahara told reporters at the World Petroleum Congress. ""In the exploration area I think Japanese companies are interested in joint ventures."" Nippon Mining, for example, last September signed an agreement with Dupont Co's &lt;DD> Conoco Inc to participate in a 135 mln dlr exploration venture that includes six wells on land and 14 offshore Louisiana. The first joint well drilled is in the Gulf of Mexico's Green Canyon Block 182, a deepwater lease that Conoco was almost forced to return to the federal government undrilled because of low oil prices. ""At this moment we have no success but we will proceed with Conoco. Maybe by the end of the year we will find oil there,"" Kasahara said. He said that similar kinds of joint ventures ""would be best"" for Nippon Mining's oil exploration efforts in the future. Kasahara also said Nippon Mining was not planning to acquire any U.S. refining or marketing outlets. ""Retail sales in general do not interest the Japanese oil companies,"" he said. When asked whether he believed world oil prices might strengthen later this year, Kasahara said he expected prices to hold steady at today's level. ""Within this year I think the 18 dlrs a barrel will continue. But next year I don't know,"" he said. ""For the refining business, stability is important. Whether the price is 18 dlrs or 20 dlrs, we don't care."" But encouraging additional upstream efforts may require modestly higher oil prices, Kasahara added. ""For exploration I think 20 dlrs a barrel or 22 dlrs a barrel would be reasonable,"" he said. The key factor in determining whether the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would raise its 18 dlr a barrel benchmark price is the ongoing war between Iran and Iraq, Kasahara said. Saudi Arabia, he added, was an uncertain element in the OPEC equation because of its need to maintain revenues at the same time the weakened U.S. dollar has reduced oil profits. Nippon Mining, which like all Japanese crude buyers is benefitting from the drop in the value of the dollar, favors continuing to price OPEC crude oil according to U.S. currency regardless of the dollar-yen relationship, Kasahara said.

""In the next two to five years, no matter what we do today, we are very likely to find the U.S becoming 50 pct or more dependent on imports for its oil requirements,"" Hodel said. If OPEC were to raise oil prices sharply, Congress would likely act to have the federal government fix gasoline prices and allocate supplies, Hodel said. ""If they allocate supplies you and I, in the same two-to-five year time frame, could well find ourselves sitting back in gas lines,"" Hodel said. Exploration for oil and gas in offshore areas and in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge would not jeopardize environmentally sensitive areas, Hodel said.

PUBLISHED-TESTSET,['crude'],"An oil import fee could cost consumers nearly 17 billion dlrs a year and undermine long-term U.S. energy security by leading to a quicker depletion of domestic reserves, a Federal Trade Commission study said. The study by the FTC's bureau of economics found that a five dlr a barrel tariff on crude oil and gasoline oil imports would increase costs to consumers by 14 to 16.7 billion dlrs a year. After weighing the benefits of such a tariff against the costs, the study found a five dlr a barrel import fee would have a net cost to the economy of 3.6 billion dlrs a year. Several oil import fee proposals ranging from two to 10 dlrs a barrel have been made in Congress in an effort to cut the federal budget deficit and maintain the momentum for energy conservation programs, which have been hurt by cheaper oil. But by making foreign oil more expensive, the tariffs would reduce oil imports and force greater consumption of domestic oil, which would deplete U.S. reserves faster, the study found. ""Any attempt to increase our energy security by limiting imports will actually reduce our long-run energy security by speeding the depletion of domestic reserves,"" the study said. The five dlr a barrel tariff would also cut domestic petroleum refiners' profits by 7.5 to 10 billion dlrs a year, increase domestic crude oil producers' profits by about 13 billion dlrs a year and raise government revenues by 6.7 to 8.2 billion dlrs a year, the FTC said. Under the Reagan administration, the FTC has consistently opposed government regulation of the oil industry at the state and federal levels. ""This study backs up my belief that government regulation and interference with competition hurt both the market and consumers,"" FTC Chairman Daniel Oliver said in a statement. Reuter &#3;"

""It seems so important to us that sometimes I ask myself 'Why don't they understand when I explain this?'"" Gonzalez said of the anti-inflation strategy designed to modernise Spain and make its economy competitive within the European Community.

PUBLISHED-TESTSET,['crude'],"The depressed offshore oil industry is still waiting for a turnaround despite increasing optimisim that world oil prices have stabilized around 18 dlrs a barrel. ""The perception of a turnaround comes from the change in prices,"" Charles Siess Jr, vice chairman of Marathon Manufacturing Co, a subsidiary of USX Corp &lt;X>, and chairman of the National Ocean Industries Association, said in a press briefing at the Offshore Technology Conference. ""From the level of industry activity, there is no turnaround,"" he added. John Huff, president of Oceaneering International Inc &lt;OCER>, was slightly more optimistic. ""We are through the low part of the cycle -- there's an increase in interest for projects,"" he said, adding, ""whether it comes to orders, who knows?"" The oil industry is recovering from last year's dramatic fall in oil prices, from 30 dlrs a barrel in late 1985 to under 10 dlrs in mid-1986. Particularly hard hit were the service companies that provide the oil rigs with keys products, such as pipe and tools. Earlier in the week, Secretary the Interior Donald Hodel announced -- at the Conference -- the government's new five-year offshore oil and gas leasing program, proposing 38 sales, including tracts in the Gulf Coast, offshore California and in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. For the most part, the industry was disappointed with the plan, with most arguing that additional areas should have been included. At the same time, most were supportive of Hodel. Environmental concerns, particularly in California, had lobbied strenuously against offshore oil development. ""The (Outer Continental Shelf) leasing program fails to take into account the environmental performance of the oil industry,"" said Bill Bradford, executive vice president of Dresser Industries &lt;DI> and president of the Petroleum Equipment Suppliers Association. Huff quoted National Academy of Science figures showing offshore rigs contributed only two pct of petroleum pollution in the oceans, while tankers were responsible for 47 pct and municiple dumping 31 pct. ""The OCS is the keystone of the domestic reserve development program,"" said Siess, adding that with oil imports rising to 50 pct of U.S. oil consumption, the issue was one of national security. Looking ahead, Constantine S. Nicandros, president of Dupont's &lt;DD> Conoco Inc subsidiary, said, ""We are more likely to see a five pct increase in spending this year than the widely-forecast five pct decrease."" Other optimistic signs include the recent sale in New Orleans of offshore tracts in the Gulf of Mexico which raised 290 mln dlrs against an expected 90 mln. However, Ronald Tappmeyer, vice chairman of Reading and Bates Drilling Co &lt;RB>, said the oversupply of rigs would continue for the near-term, but added demand for technologically advanced rigs would increase in the 1990s. Much of that demand is seen coming from the move into icreasingly deeper waters, with the projects becoming ever more expensive and needing five to ten years to develop. Over 50 pct of the sales in New Orleans were for deep water tracts. Ronald L. Geer, a consultant with Shell Oil Co, a subsidiary of Royal Dutch/Shell &lt;RD>, and president of the Marine Technology Society, said the technology existed to drill exploratory wells in up to 10,000 feet of water. Geer said the industry was particularly interested in the Green Canyon field offshore Louisiana where a number of companies, including Shell, Conoco, USX Corp's Marathon Oil Co, Standard Oil Co &lt;SRD> and Placid Oil Co, are working, many of them testing new deep-water technologies involving floating platforms.

Both measures, which take effect on May 1, were approved by the cabinet. They will be announced to the nation by Lusinchi in a televised address tonight but the text of the decrees was released this afternoon. Businessmen, who met Lusinchi, opposed the pay rise, saying it will fuel inflation. The inflation rate was 11.5 pct in 1986 and private economists say it will be 25 to 30 pct in 1987. The central bank said first quarter inflation was 6.3 pct. The wage increase for public and private sector employees will be 30 pct on salaries of up to 2,100 bolivars a month. For salaries of from 2,101 to 6,100 bolivars 25 pct and for those of 6,101 to 20,000 bolivars 20 pct. The measures were taken in response to a request from the Venezuelan confederation CTV for an increase to offset the loss in the purchasing power of workers' salaries. It estimated the loss at 40 pct. The general wage rise is the third granted by Lusinchi since his government took office in February 1984. The wage increases are a bonus and will not be considered in calculating benefits or severance pay, the decree said. At the same time, Lusinchi declared a freeze on lay-offs and firings for the next 120 days. The price freeze applies to a group of 120 foods and other consumer goods declared to be ""of primary necessity.""

PUBLISHED-TESTSET,['veg-oil'],"Plans for key reforms of the European Community's (EC) controversial farm policy will almost certainly have to be referred to the bloc's heads of government at a summit meeting on June 29 and 30, Belgian finance minister Mark Eyskens said today. Eyskens was speaking at a news conference after chairing a joint meeting of EC finance and agriculture ministers which was designed to help break a deadlock over this year's EC farm price package which has endured since March. Diplomats quoted EC Executive Commission president Jacques Delors as saying at the same meeting that it would be a disaster if the two most difficult issues at the farm talks had to be referred to heads of government. These issues are a Commission plan for a tax on marine and vegetable fats and oils, and proposals to change the system by which EC farm prices, expressed in European currency units (Ecus), are translated into the currencies of member states. The oils and fats tax is opposed by a group of countries which fears it could provoke trade retaliation by the U.S., A major exporter of soybeans to the EC. West Germany, meanwhile, is strongly against the technical currency move, which would result in additional price cuts for farmers in countries with strong currencies, such as the mark. Commission sources said Delors is anxious that the two issues are not referred to the summit because this would mean heads of government diverting their attention from much more important world and Community issues. Eyskens said decisions from heads of government were also likely to be less sound since they do not usually interest themselves in such technically complex questions. However, Eyskens said today's meeting had thrown up some nuances in member state positions ""which may make the dialogue more constructive in the next few weeks."" If farm prices are not decided by the end of this month, the Commission could use its own powers to impose a seven pct cut in cereals prices, farm trade sources said. It originally proposed measures to cut farm spending by 1.1 billion Ecus this year, with effective price cuts of over 10 pct for some crops. Diplomats said farm ministers might be able to agree a price package cutting spending by around 340 mln Ecus but for their disagreements on the oils/fats tax and on currency reforms. The finance ministers were called in to emphasise the need for budgetary restraint in the face of an almost certain EC budget deficit of over five billion Ecus this year. Although Delors was said by aides to have found today's meeting very useful, diplomats said there was little sign of a major shift in the position of member states, or of finance ministers adopting a different line from that of their agriculture colleagues.

They said the crop is still likely to be fairly large and it is too early to determine the consequences of the dry spell on the harvest. ""This year's crop will probably be another good one. It is impossible to tell how flowering is going, but there should be no problems unless something drastic happens,"" one trader said. Private forecaster Accu-Weather reported today that most Ivory Coast cocoa growing regions were without rain over the weekend and similar weather will persist today and Tuesday. ""Rain would be welcomed, as the past week has been quite dry, except along the western portion of the coast,"" it said. Traders agreed rain was needed, but some noted that the dry conditions had not affected the entire country. The Ivorian Meteorological Office could not be reached for comment or recent statistics. The trade sources said rainfall in recent weeks was likely insufficient for cocoa plants, although it is difficult to assess what the minimum requirements are. Trade sources said there had been good rains in late January, February and March which helped to promote flowering, but April and May were fairly dry in most areas except in the south west of the country. The Ivory Coast mid-crop should have been covered by March/April rains but the main crop, still in its formation period, depends largely on rainfall from April through July. The main rains normally last between May and July, before returning again in September/October. ""Flowering has been less than normal and if the trees are not carrying that much at the moment, then they have a chance to recover,"" one trader said. Another trade source noted the flowers still had plenty of time to develop and the rains were ""not good but still not bad."" The sources said that while the weather might emerge as a cause for concern, crop conditions in West Africa were presently taking a back seat to other factors in the international cocoa market. This is not only because of the premature nature of any harvest predictions but also because of the supply of cocoa already burdening the market, they said.

PUBLISHED-TESTSET,['veg-oil'],"Bonn is expected to rush through legislation this month creating special credits to protect West German farmers from a proposed European Community, EC, payments freeze, government sources said. The new measures are apparently designed to shield West German farmers from the consequences of the looming EC budget crisis and give Bonn scope to keep up its opposition to the EC executive commission's farm policy reform plans, political sources said. EC finance and farm minsters held an unprecedented joint session in Luxembourg today to try to solve the stalemate over future farm financing. West Germany has proved the main obstacle to Commission attempts to raise fresh funds for farm financing by taxing imports of vegetable oil and fats, for fear of U.S. retaliation. Bonn has also opposed the abolition of an agri-monetary mechanism that acts as a subsidy for West German farm exports. The draft legislation, which the ruling centre-right coalition will present to parliament tomorrow, would provide temporary credits for farm subsidies usually paid by Brussels. The Commission, facing a five billion European Currency Units (5.73 billion dlrs) budget deficit by the end of the year, has threatened to start phasing out payment of some subsidies and premiums from August, unless EC member states take urgent measures to provide fresh funds. West German Agriculture Minister Ignaz Kiechle gave the new legislation top priority after last month's failure to agree to a farm price package for 1986/87. Political sources in Bonn said Kiechle decided to take the sting out of proposed Commission measures to cut back subsidies by creating a buffer for West German farmers. The opposition SPD has agreed to back the Kiechle bill and allow its hasty passage through parliament by July 1, ahead of the summer recess, SPD sources said. SPD farm policy spokesman Jan Oostergetelo said his party would support the bill, even though it would further swell massive government spending on agriculture. He said the bill was an admission that the government believes the farm price talks will fail and the EC faces bankruptcy. According to a copy of the draft bill obtained by Reuters, government authorities will have over two billion marks (1.1 billion dlrs) available to pay farmers advance subsidies and premiums for grains and other crops harvested this summer. The Commission has agreed to pay the subsidies eventually. But paying farmers on time will cost Bonn about 100 mln marks (55 mln dlrs) in interest payments, farm policy sources said. Chancellor Helmut Kohl's cabinet is expected to support the bill when it meets tomorrow. Reuter &#3;"
PUBLISHED-TESTSET,"['dlr', 'money-fx']","Treasury Secretary James Baker said any further decline in the dollar against other currencies would be counterproductive. Baker was asked after a speech to the Pan American Economic Leadership Conference about U.S. policy in light of President Reagan's comment last week at the Venice summit that he could see some further decline in the dollar within reason. ""All of the G-7 nations believe that any further decline in the dollar would be counterproductive,"" Baker told reporters. Following the Venice press conference by Reagan, the White House clarified Reagan's comments on the dollar by saying that the United States wants a stable dollar. The main incentive for the United States to favor a weaker dollar has been the need to reduce the massive trade deficit, but the deficit has narrowed for the past two months and appears to be responding to the 40 pct drop in the dollar against the yen and the mark during the past two years.

Government spokesman Friedhelm Ost said Chancellor Helmut Kohl will review a joint proposal by steel employers and trade unions at a meeting on the ailing industry tomorrow. Both steel employers and union leaders are expected to tell Kohl tomorrow that the Government has failed to do enough to protect German steel firms from subsidies and unfair competition from other European Community members. Government sources said Bonn was prepared to take part in a common effort to find a solution for the steelworkers. But since the Government is struggling to finance tax cuts by slashing state subsidies, it is not prepared to pick up the whole bill for the layoffs, the sources said. A spokesman for IG Metall, the metalworkers' trade union, said the proposal seeks redundancy payments to 10,000 workers in Ruhr and Rhineland plants. Some 6,000 workers would be redeployed in non-steel making sectors of steel companies, while a further 4,000 would be eligible for job-retraining schemes. The union estimates that the redundancy payments would total 600 million marks (340 million dollars), while job retraining schemes would cost a further 240 million marks (130 million dollars). Up to 30,000 West German steel jobs are at risk in the next few years following steep losses incurred by the industry since mid-1986. Extensive restructuring of the industry in recent years was unable to compensate for the effects of the weak dollar which depressed foreign demand for steel, industry sources said. Reuter &#3;"
PUBLISHED-TESTSET,"['grain', 'corn', 'oilseed', 'soybean']","The U.S. corn and soybean crops are in mostly good condition and have not suffered any yield deterioration from recent hot, dry weather, Agriculture Department and private weather and crop analysts said. ""I don't see any reduction in yield potential yet,"" Norton Strommen, chief meteorologist at USDA told Reuters. ""The (corn and soybean) crop is actually in mostly good condition and is progressing ahead of normal, which is good,"" he said. Abnormally hot, dry weather in midwestern crop areas sparked a sharp rally in Chicago futures today, causing new crop soybeans to advance the 30 cent daily limit to 6.14 dlrs per bushel and September corn to go up 12 cents to 2.81 dlrs. ""This rally is amazing,"" a private crop analyst said. ""Corn, soybeans and wheat are in excellent condition."" The USDA meteorologist said the only effects of the warm, dy weather on crops so far has probably been to speed up development of the crop, which will help the crop better cope with stress later in its more critical growing period. ""What this weather will do is simply push the crop towards rapid development of a good, deep root system to draw on the subsoil reserve. It actually strengthens the crop to go through a little stress early on,"" Strommen said. Strommen noted that subsoil moisture is in good shape in most growing areas. Strommen and other private crop analysts noted corn and soybeans will not enter their critical growth stages until July and August. But because of its early development this year, Strommen said the midwestern corn crop could enter its reproduction period by the first of July. ""Weatherwise, if the market is truly concerned about corn or soybeans, it should be more concerned about corn. But the dryness still has to last for another two to three weeks,"" an analyst said. Soybeans, on the other hand, can withstand several more weeks of dryness before yields start deteriorating, crop analysts agreed. August and September are the critical yield-producing months for soybeans, Strommen said. ""The sole purpose of the soybean plant is to simply survive during May, June and July until the August rains which determine the crop,"" a crop analyst said. Some analysts contend, however, that in certain growing areas the crop has not been receiving enough moisture to ensure that there will not be problems later. Strommen noted the USDA's current six to 10 day weather forecast calls for above normal temperatures and below normal precipitation in much of the corn belt.

All months set life-of-contract highs and November closed at 6.23 dlrs a bushel. ""The market is anticipating that it will stay hotter than normal for some time out,"" said David Bartholomew, assistant vice president for Merrill Lynch. ""We have probably gone as high as we need to go at this time, but I don't know how to measure the euphoria level."" Soymeal futures, which led the grain rally last week, posted contract highs and ended up the 10 dlr a ton daily limit in new-crop contracts. December closed at 195.70 dlrs. Corn futures set contract highs in March through September, with December closing up the 10 cent a bushel limit at 2.11-3/4 dlrs. Wheat posted more modest gains as dry weather improved harvest conditions in the southern Midwest. The hot weather could stress developing corn and soybean plants in the Midwest, although some periods of dryness benefit young plants by encouraging the development of deep root systems, Bartholomew said. European demand for U.S. soybeans and meal contributed to active buying here and an estimated 2.0 mln bushels of soybean orders went unfilled at the close, traders said. After trading ended, a U.S. Agriculture Department (USDA) meteorologist said the U.S. corn and soybean crops have not suffered any yield loss yet from hot, dry weather. Strong grain futures ignored weakness in the value of the dollar, which can depress prices by making grains more expensive for foreign buyers. But the surge in soybeans encouraged buying at New York's COMEX, where silver futures recovered from early lows to settle steady. Managed fund traders bought silver on the belief that the weather-spurred jump in grain futures will revive fears of inflation. But the weak dollar pressured COMEX gold futures, which closed down following last Friday's news of improved U.S. trade deficit figures and better U.S. producer prices. A USDA report released after trading said the number of cattle being fed in seven major producing states was above levels expected by traders. Traders said the report would probably push live cattle futures lower tomorrow at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

A total of 1.954 mln head were placed on feed during May, up 111 pct from a year ago, and May cattle marketings were off 93 pct at 1.524 mln head, USDA said.

PUBLISHED-TESTSET,['gold'],"The glitter of gold has generated a three-way competition among the world's largest futures exchanges for a 100-ounce contract for the precious metal. When the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) re-introduces gold futures trading here Tuesday (at 9 a.m. CDT), it will go toe-to-toe in an uphill battle against the Commodity Exchange Inc. of New York (Comex), which brokerage executives describe as the world's precious metals futures capital for institutional business. And by autumn, the oldest and biggest exchange, the Chicago Board of Trade (CBT), expects to join the fray when the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) approves a pending application for a 100-ounce gold contract to trade side-by-side with the CBT's smaller, one kilogram (about 2.5 U.S. pounds) gold futures. The CME introduced a 100-ounce gold futures contract in 1974, but lack of interest forced it to abandon the instrument in July 1986. CME officials said investors and brokerage firms asked the exchange to reintroduce the contract because of recent volatility in precious metals. Other factors influencing the decision may also have been clearing problems in May which forced the Comex to shorten trading for three straight days in an effort to clear up a huge backlog of unresolved trades, especially in silver futures. Comex's problems may now create a window of opportunity for other exchanges to successfully offer precious metals contracts, industry sources say. But it is much too early to predict whether other exchanges can inflict serious damage on the Comex' daily trading volume of more than 40,000 contracts which represents commitments to buy and sell gold of more than 2 billion dlrs. While average daily trading in the CBT's smaller gold contract, aimed at retail customers rather than institutions, was under 500 contracts per day throughout 1986, it has surpassed 1,000 contracts daily for the past two months. ""The climate could not be better for this venture by the CME,"" said Merrill Lynch Commodity Marketing Vice President Neil McGarrity. ""Everybody is talking about metals now, and interesting daily trading ranges provide opportunities for bulls and bears. There's good trading volume in all world outlets,"" McGarrity added. ""The Merc's gold futures would be insurance for dealers, merchants and customers that there would be a market open for trading,"" if heavy gold or silver futures volume causes the Comex to close early again, said Jack Lehman, senior vice president and director of commodities for Shearson Lehman Bros. Inc. and a Comex board member. Delivery points vary for each exchange's 100-ounce gold futures. Comex contracts are deliverable through New York warehouses while the CME contract specifies London delivery through a CME account at Samuel Montagu and Co. Ltd., a member of the London gold market. The CBT gold application specifies delivery from New York and Chicago vaults. The Comex and the CBT have applied to the CFTC for an earlier precious metals opening to match the CME's starting time of 7:20 a.m. CDT. The exchanges said the earlier start allows for trading before many important government reports are released at 7:30 a.m. CDT. CME marketing sources said arbitrage possibilities exist with side-by-side trading, noting local interests can be generated by traders dealing in foreign currency and short-term debt futures along with gold futures contracts to further hedge their financial risks. ""If the dollar rises, traders can sell currencies and buy gold,"" said David Johnson, CME's manager of currency products. The Chicago Board of Trade sees an extra advantage to gold trading. ""Given our night trading session, we could add either our pending 100-ounce gold or our existing 5,000-ounce silver contract to attract overseas business,"" a CBT official said. Which market is identified as the precious metal capital does not appear to be a major issue among professionals. ""We've seen Chicago bring in a new constituency before, with perhaps different needs,"" Mocatta Metals Chairman Dr. Henry Jarecki said. ""Merchants will go to the CME or anywhere to trade a liquid contract. Our firm is no exception,"" Jarecki said. ""At worst, even if the CME gold futures fail, the Comex will be under pressure to improve the integrity of its clearing processes,"" a CME official added. Reuter &#3;"

The Commission will meet in Strasbourg following what diplomats described as a largely fruitless special joint meeting of farm and finance ministers on the issue in Luxembourg Monday. Commission officials said farm commissioner Frans Andriessen will ask the 17-man body for permission to present farm ministers with a compromise plan revising proposals for 1987/88 farm prices which have divided them since they were first announced in March. The most controversial aspects of these proposals are a plan to tax all vegetable and marine oils and fats to finance rapidly increasing production subsidies and technical measures which would change the way common EC farm prices are converted into member state currencies. West German delegation sources, who have opposed both plans fiercely, said if the Commission dropped the oils and fats tax plan and modified the currency proposals, there would be a chance of agreement on other aspects of the package. These include measures to cut the effective price paid to farmers for cereals and some other crops by over 10 pct. But a Commission spokesman said any new proposals would include plans for revising the current oils and fats and currency regulations. The Commission is anxious to avoid a complete deadlock in meetings of EC farm ministers here this week as it fears issues could then be referred to the EC heads of government summit at the end of the month. Commission president Jacques Delors, who wants to ensure the summit has ample time to consider proposals for new means of financing the cash-strapped EC, said yesterday it would be ""disastrous"" if farm issues had to be discussed by government leaders.

Although Delors' aides described the joint meeting as useful in clarifying the issues, some diplomats said it seemed to have merely confirmed member states' long held positions. Indeed, they said an extra state, Spain, seemed to have lined up with the four others already opposing the oils and fats tax, West Germany, Britain, Denmark and Portugal. Reuter &#3;"
PUBLISHED-TESTSET,['jobs'],"The growing shift of low-skilled manufacturing jobs from the United States to Mexican border cities is not a threat to American employment because it will help create new markets for products, according to a study released today. Richard Bolin, director of the Flagstaff Institute of Arizona, which studies international trade issues, said the United States needs to encourage the expansion of manufacturing in developing countries so that those nations can become consumers of more U.S. goods. His study was commissioned by the border city of McAllen, Texas, for presentation to the International Trade Commission which is gathering information for a report to Congress on what changes may be needed in the U.S. tariff codes to prevent the loss of jobs and industry. McAllen and other Texas border cities have benefitted from a trend among U.S. companies to build twin plants that employ factory workers on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border. More than 700 manufacturers are taking advantage of lenient tax codes that allow U.S. companies to bring raw goods into Mexico for assembly by low-skilled workers into products that are completed by U.S. workers at a nearby sister plant. Bolin said his research indicated that the shift in low-paying jobs across the border reflected changing demographics of the U.S. workforce. ""In the post-baby boom era, fewer workers will be available to fill these low-skill jobs -- and these workers will be better educated than prior generations,"" Bolin told reporters in McAllen. ""The jobs in low-tech industries that are being exported to other countries are, for the most part, jobs that we may not be able to fill in the future."" U.S. employment in less-skilled manufacturing jobs plunged by more than 900,000 between 1977 and 1982, largely due to the transfer of jobs outside U.S. borders, he said. American employment in high-tech industries increased by 634,000 during the same period, he said.

Using 1973 as a base year, the ministry said inflation differentials pointed to a yen/dollar rate of 172 in fourth quarter 1986. The dollar opened here today at 144.90 yen. MITI also said the so-called ""J-curve"" and the drop in oil prices together accounted for 33.2 billion dlrs of the 36.6 billion dlr rise in Japan's trade surplus last year. On a customs cleared basis, the Japanese trade surplus rose to a record 82.66 billion dlrs last year. The ministry said the fall in oil prices accounted for 16.5 billion dlrs and the ""J-curve"" 17.2 billion dlrs of the rise in the 1986 surplus. Analyzing the expansion in Japan's trade imbalance in recent years, MITI calculated that 37 pct of it could be accounted for by exchange rates, 24 pct by differences in economic growth rates between Japan and other countries, and 36 pct by so-called price elasticities of imports and exports. Analyzing the expansion in the U.S. Trade deficit from 1982 to 1985, the ministry said 24 pct was accounted for by exchange rates, 34 pct by differences in the income elasticity of imports and exports and 39 pct by differences in economic growth rates. The figures do not tally to 100 pct because other minor factors have been left out. ""One index of trade structure, the income elasticity of exports and imports, shows that the U.S. Is more likely to experience increases in imports, while Japan is structurally predisposed to growth in exports,"" MITI said. Structural adjustment is already underway in Japan, under the impact of the strong yen, MITI said. Japanese companies are stepping up their imports and expanding capacity overseas. Japanese consumer attitudes are also changing. The ministry cited a survey showing that price was now the number one factor in the purchase of imports from the U.S. And Western Europe, replacing design and brand reputations. ""The smooth adjustment of the economic structure calls for measures to address the needs of affected firms,"" it said. ""Whole industries have felt the pinch and employment is expected to suffer."" ""Sustained economic growth, led by domestic demand, will also be an essential condition,"" the ministry said. It said four structural factors have contributed to the growth of the U.S. Trade deficit in recent years -- a decline in U.S. Industrial competitiveness, insufficient productive capacity, an increase in foreign procurement by U.S. Companies and short-sighted U.S. Management attitudes.

PUBLISHED-TESTSET,['gnp'],"Government officials said the worst may be over for the Japanese economy, after today's news of stronger than expected growth in the January/March period. But private economists were not so sure and said the economy was unlikely to achieve the government's 3.5 pct growth forecast in the current fiscal year ending next March. As already reported, GNP rose 1.2 pct in the January/March quarter, after a revised 0.7 pct increase in the previous three months. For the fiscal year that ended last March 31, GNP growth slowed to 2.6 pct from 4.3 pct in 1985/86. The government economists acknowledged that the improved export performance in the January/March quarter was unlikely to be repeated. The volume of exports during the period was up two pct from the previous three months. The yen's rise in April to about 140 to the dollar from 150 probably resulted in a fall in exports in the April/June quarter, they said. However, given the yen's recent stability, stepped-up domestic demand should work as a driving force to push the economy onto a path of sustainable growth, they said. Many private economists, though, doubt that the economy will achieve the government's 3.5 pct growth forecast for the 1987/88 year. Growth in 1986/87 also fell short of the government's forecast, which was revised downwards to three pct last December from an original four pct. Domestic demand as a whole is not strong enough, except for housing, said Johsen Takahashi, chief economist at Mitsubishi Research Institute. Consumer spending is likely to remain weak as the growth in nominal income stays low, he added. The rise in consumer spending in the January-March quarter was simply a reflection of the contraction that occurred in the preceding three months, Takahashi said. Private capital spending in the quarter looked strong but this was primarily because utility companies brought forward their 1987/88 capital investment plans into the final quarter of 1986/87 in line with the government's economic stimulation package announced last fall, he said. Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank chief economist Kosaku Furuta said he was unable to say the economy has bottomed out, but added he expects increasing signs of recovery in the coming months. Destocking is coming to an end and companies are starting to rebuild inventories, Furuta said.

PUBLISHED-TESTSET,"['zinc', 'lead', 'copper']","Next year is likely to see a shortfall in zinc concentrates of up to 100,000 tonnes, although there should be ample supply in 1987, Shearson Lehman Brothers Ltd metals analyst Stephen Briggs said. Speaking on the second day of Metal Bulletin's base metals conference, Briggs said the major factor in his predicted 100,000 tonne shortfall in zinc concentrate supply in 1988 was the imminent cessation of new mining and termination of milling at Pine Point in Canada. However, this could be partially offset by some stockpiles. Nevertheless, despite this predicted shortfall there was unlikely to be any dramatic change in treatment charges in 1988. The picture for 1987, on the other hand, was one of record production of zinc metal with fewer strikes anticipated in Canada, some improvement in South America and new capacity in South Korea. ""Dramatic new record levels of concentrate output are also expected in 1987,"" Briggs said. This would partly be due to a return to more normal levels at existing mines in Australia and Peru, allied with achievement of full capacity of 170,000 tonnes a year at Faro in Canada. Looking further forward, the major event was the probable opening in 1991 of the Red Dog mine in Alaska with a capacity of 300,000 tonnes of concentrates a year. ""Once this mine is fully on stream it is unlikely that there will be a major shortage of concentrates in the early 1990s,"" he added. The picture for lead was also closely allied to that of zinc, with no new dedicated lead mines planned and therefore supply of concentrates largely dependent on by-products from zinc mines. ""On this basis, our calculations point to a modest oversupply of lead concentrates in 1987,"" Briggs said. The copper forecast, however, was for a record non-Socialist output of 6.6 mln tonnes of concentrates in 1987, increasing by a further 150,000 tonnes in 1988. Production of primary refined copper metal would also increase, but not by as much as concentrate output, leading to a moderate oversupply of concentrates of up to 150,000 tonnes this year and with no shortages predicted for the rest of the decade, he said.

But Kato said he has no plans to start bilateral trade talks with the United States over rice, Japan's staple food. Washington has called Tokyo's rice policy an extreme example of protectionism and has demanded access for U.S. Growers to the Japanese market. This is closed to imports except in emergency. Kato said Japanese farmers should however ""shed some blood,"" to relieve the dangerous state of international farm trade. His comments precede a meeting on July 1 and 2 of the Rice Price Council at which the government advisory body will discuss the 1987 crop producer rice price. Kato said he welcomed the outcome of last week's recent summit of leaders of leading industrialised democracies in Venice and of farm trade talks at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in May.

PUBLISHED-TESTSET,"['money-fx', 'reserves', 'trade']","Parliament approved a proposal to drop all controls on capital outflows, raising the prospect that Taiwan's vast resevoir of foreign exchange will flow into the world economy. A government spokesman said the new law would be promulgated by President Chiang Ching-Kuo within 10 days and financial authorities would then be empowered to lift controls on currency outflows at any time. Tight restrictions on capital inflows introduced this year will remain in place, the spokesman said. Central Bank Governor Chang Chi-Cheng has said the controls will be lifted at the end of next month or early in August. The central bank and finance ministry proposed lifting currency restrictions to help reduce Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves, which stand at about 60 billion U.S. Dlrs and have led to runaway growth in money supply. The reserves, the world's third largest after Japan and West Germany, also draw attention to Taiwan's huge trade surplus and the government fears they are making the island a target for U.S. Trade protectionism. The surplus rose 34 pct to a record 7.32 billion U.S. Dlrs in the first five months of this year and about 90 pct of it was with the United States. Money supply rose a seasonally adjusted 51.9 pct in the year to end-April, raising fears of higher inflation. Local bankers and economists say when the controls are lifted, businessmen will be allowed to buy foreign currency and invest it freely overseas. But they warn against expectations of a sudden outflow of capital. ""I don't think we're going to see a big bang,"" John Brinsden, the Taiwan manager of Standard Chartered Bank told Reuters in a recent interview. Bankers said that businessmen have been holding vast quantities of foreign exchange overseas for many years and also have been freely buying and exporting currency through a flourishing black-market. ""Obviously there will be an outflow of funds ... But I don't think it's going to be much,"" said Danny Chan, director of Fidelity Securities Investment Consulting Corp. Economists say the success of plans to encourage capital outflow depend on whether the central bank can slow the rise of the local currency. The Taiwan dollar has risen by about 23 pct against the U.S. Dollar since September 1983, prompting an inflow of speculative money. It rose by one Taiwan cent today to close at 31.08. The government spokesman said the new law does not empower authorities to permanently lift capital controls, but any proposal to reimpose them would need the approval of parliament.

Speaking on the second day of the Metal Bulletin base metals conference, Bue said he expected the current talks between five smelters including Penarroya to result in integration between at least some of the companies before 1990. The five companies, SMM Penarroya, Outokumpu Oy, Preussag Ag, Ste de la Vieille Montagne and Boliden Ore and Metals AB, have 22 pct of the world market, Bue added. ""We have no alternative than to integrate out businesses into large trading blocs if we are to survive the cut-throat price competition and the trend to forward integration from the mining companies,"" Bue said. ""It is by no means certain that all the five companies involved in the talks will integrate together. It is quite likely, and even preferable, that the European smelters form two or three large integrated blocs. ""In this way we will be better able to negotiate with our concentrate suppliers on one side, and with the metal buyers on the other,"" Bue added. In the past, production overcapacity and the intense competition between the European zinc smelters has meant they have not only been in a very weak negotiating position when buying concentrates, but in an even weaker one when selling the metal, Bue noted. Although the apparently easy solution is to simply shut down excess capacity, the burden of this on individual companies is far too heavy and no one can be expected to volunteer, he added. Another possible but very risky solution is to invest heavily in more modern and lower cost facilities, he said. ""My answer to this suggestion is that individual companies who do not invest will surely die, and those that do invest might survive, but only might, "" Bue said. ""The only real option in my mind is integration, rationalization and stabilization. We have no alternative, "" he added. Bue also said that the European smelters were completely dissatisfied with the tradition of pricing concentrates and metals in US dollars, and suggested moving either to a basket of the world's major currencies or pricing in European currency units (Ecus) to protect against exchange rate volatility. Bue's views on integration between European smelters were met by general approval from the conference audience comprising representatives from many of the world's major mining, smelting and trading companies, although some of the mining representatives were somewhat sceptical in view of their own industry's move towards integration with smelters. However, some concentrate traders did express worry about their own position if the metals industry does make the move to large trading blocs. The currency basket suggestion cropped up constantly, but few said they thought matters would change in the near future. REUTER &#3;"

However, the tax on marine oils and fats would be cut by 50 pct from originally envisaged levels, the document said. In addition, the Commission proposes that the level of the tax, expected to start at 330 Ecus per tonne, could be reviewed every three months rather than annually. Diplomatic sources said the change to the proposals for fish oils appears to be an attempt to overcome objections to the tax from Portugal and Spain, major fishing nations. Other countries opposing the tax include Britain, West Germany and Denmark. The new proposals retain most of the Commission's original plans in other sectors. However, they mark the Commission's recognition that it cannot get proposals to reduce the period of intervention for cereals, diplomats said. Instead the Commission proposes to cut the monthly increments applied to cereals during the November to May period when intervention is open to 2.7 Ecus a tonne for durum wheat and two Ecus a tonne for other cereals.
