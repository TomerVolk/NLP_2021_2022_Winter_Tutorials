422,so like many young children my daughter tatum age NUMBER months really likes music she also likes to have control over her environment and this means she wants to be the one putting cds into the cd player and getting the music playing by watching tatum i ve discovered that you can learn a lot about ui design from watching NUMBER month olds use technology there is definitely a market niche for a toddler friendly cd mpNUMBER player the cd player we have combines play and pause in a single button but doesn t provide instantaneous feedback that the button was pushed instead requiring you to wait until the music starts NUMBER NUMBER seconds this is a ui disaster since tatum doesn t get feedback right away she presses the button again thereby pausing the cd before it even plays she ll only ever get music if she presses the button an odd number of times this happens a surprising amount of the time since she eventually hits the button again when the music doesn t play for toddlers pressing play must cause the music to start immediately within half a second for the toddler to get the causality and not press the button multiple times as well pressing the button multiple times shouldn t change the semantics like an elevator button no matter how many times you press the elevator still comes to that floor the play button needs to be the same the back hinged door mechanism feeding the cd into the player is also a ui disaster for tatum since the door hinges on the back tatum has to angle cds to put them in and take them out putting cds in isn t much of a problem but taking them out is since tatum grabs cds by the back edge that edge comes out first hitting the lid tatum eventually forces and wiggles the cd out a process that s hard on the cd and the player but which hasn t yet resulted in the cd player being broken surprisingly it hasn t been a problem getting the cd hole onto the spindle tatum seems to understand this concept and the cd load area geometry naturally guides the cd tatum s cd player also plays tapes and has fm radio for a toddler this is a mistake tatum doesn t understand the need to flick a switch to put the player into a specific mode she understands putting a cd in and pressing the play button she sometimes understands the buttons for advancing a song but uses them erratically as well the radio feature has both fm mono and fm stero a distinction totally lost on tatum tatum only understands the binary distinction of music no music what would the ideal toddler cd player be like it would immediately start playing a cd after it was loaded as soon as the cd load door was closed it would give some audible feedback it would have a single large play button the other typical cd controls would be larger than normal but at least half the size of the play button and located far away from the play button so there is no chance of them getting accidentally pressed on the way to play the play button would be a bright color that is different from the color of the player and different from the color of the other cd control keys the device would only play cds no other functions the cd load area would flip open at least NUMBER degrees it should be small approachable for a toddler it should be possible to repeatedly drop the player from a height of NUMBER NUMBER without affecting the player jim ,0

708,oh they were plenty upset about the tea taxes but the crack down on colonial script certainly screwed over the american colonies and btw england as well dear ben franklin was right for the wrong reasons first of all the colonies were not prosperous compared to england proper second the issuance of colonial script had nothing to do with full employeement in fact it is almost inconceivable he would make that claim it sounds like a modern keynsian was creating an urban legend otoh the lack of sufficient circulating monetary instruments was economically crippling imagine trying to buy your supplies by offering ious on your own name and then trying to market exchange the paper as the merchant who took the iou the most common problem in the world is when a government prints too much money the effects are a complete disaster there are a lot of incentives that push governments into doing this even though it is incredibly stupid so almost all the literature talks about that but you can also screw an economy over by taking all the money out of circulation the fundamental cause of the american great depression was exactly this courtesy of the federal reserve board i don t think shifting the power to print money to the bank of canada had much effect and canada is still a prosperous country original message from fork admin URL mailto fork admin URL on behalf of gary lawrence murphy sent saturday september NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER am to mr fork cc fork URL subject re sed s united states roman empire g f fork list mr writes f free trade and free markets have proven their ability to lift f whole societies out of poverty i m not a f socio political history buff does anybody have some clear f examples china ooops no wait scratch that there is one counter example that i can think of but it may not be precisely free trade markets when ben franklin first visited england he was asked why the colonies were so prosperous ben explained that they used colonial script a kind of barter dollar and increasing the supply of script ensured complete employment the british bankers were furious and immediately lobbied parliament to clamp down on the practice within a few years the colonies were rife with unemployment and poverty just like the rest of the empire according to questionable literature handed out by a fringe political party here in canada the founding fathers had no real complaint about tea taxes it was the banning of colonial script they were protesting if this is true then it comes right back to the forces that killed ned ludd s followers as to why popular opinion believes they were protesting a tea tax the same pamphlet claimed that canada was also a prosperous nation until by an act of parliament in the late NUMBER s or early NUMBER s the right to print money was removed from the juristiction of parliament and handed over to the bank of canada i ve wondered about all this certainly the timeline of the collapse of the canadian economy fits the profile but there are oodles of other causes for example spending money like we had NUMBERm people when we only had NUMBERm anyone have any further information on this gary lawrence murphy garym URL teledynamics communications blog URL biz URL computers are useless they can only give you answers picasso ,0

these guides on your computer s hard disk as other people will be ordering these guides from you paying you for them and you will need to email the guides to the new buyers step NUMBER from the list of names above delete the name and address of the person shown under guide NUMBER and replace that slot with the name and address of the person from guide NUMBER s slot be sure to copy the name and address exactly as shown check the address again step NUMBER delete name and address under guide NUMBER and replace with the name and address from guide NUMBER s slot step NUMBER delete name and address under guide NUMBER and replace with the name and address from guide NUMBER s slot step NUMBER delete name and address under guide NUMBER and replace with the name and address from guide NUMBER s slot step NUMBER delete name and address under guide NUMBER and replace with your own name and address this step is how your own name and address is entered into the list of names to receive orders for the guides eventually your own name will go down the list of names until you have reached guide NUMBER and then be dropped from the list the key point is that the number of people ordering guides from you will grow larger the lower down the list your name goes step NUMBER once you have completed this new list send out this new email which shows your name under guide NUMBER to as many email addresses as possible as many as NUMBER NUMBER emails or even more the greater the number of mailings you make potentially the greater the number of people who will order the guide NUMBER from you these people will then make new emails to send out to their addresses with the email showing your name under guide NUMBER and so on this is all you need to do if you wish to read the rest of this email message then do so if not just do the NUMBER steps shown above remember the key point is to send out as many emails as possible in step NUMBER and to encourage and help those who purchase the guides from you to send out emails of their own do not change anything other than what is instructed because if you do it will not work for you your immediate reaction might be why not replace all the names on the list with the names of your spouse kids relatives and friends that might seem to you like a clever move because new buyers will be sending their money to these people but that move is the exact opposite of what is to your benefit what will benefit you most is having people who will send out emails seek new buyers and provide assistance to new buyers if the people you slip into that list aren t going to be sending new emails you re only hurting yourself by effectively closing down the program with your name on top of the list of the names that you have inserted there wouldn t be new buyers coming in so your sly maneuver will gain you exactly zero furthermore if you have done the work and your name has worked its way to further down the list by then you deserve the rewards and earnings from that effort and it would be unethical for anyone to remove your name for whatever reason don t do it to others remember honesty reaps the reward you may have a concern that after sending the total NUMBER to the five people on the list that one of the people will just take your money and not send you the guide well rest assured as we said above it s to our benefit to have you as a satisfied buyer who will actively send out emails to find new buyers so don t think the people on the list will try to cheat you or to stiff you for NUMBER NUMBER the people on the list would rather have you working hard because your effort will benefit them as well as you later on when other buyers send you the order to buy the guides fulfill your end of the deal by sending the ordered guide to the buyer don t cheat provide efficient and honest service and we will all benefit end of summary rest of message with easy to use email tools and opt in email success in this business is now well within the capabilities of ordinary people who may not have done any internet marketing before and the earnings potential is staggering read this email to the end follow what it says and you will not worry whether a recession is coming or not or whether or not you can afford to buy that new car or home that you have been looking for yes i know what you are thinking i never responded to one of these before either one day though something made me feel you use NUMBER going to a movie for NUMBER hours with your spouse friend or child plus a simple meat at a restaurant why the heck not no

greater is the amount of money from a small increase in the response rate there are over NUMBER million people on the internet worldwide and counting with thousands more coming online every day method NUMBER placing free ads on the internet advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are many free places to advertise placing a lot of free ads on the internet will get a response we

the people you buy these guides from will assist and advise you how to get the large number of email addresses that you need to send the new email containing your name and address in return when

buyers will buy from you this is no different than customer service in the retail or the bricks and mortars business available guides the reason for the cash is not because this is illegal or somehow wrong it is simply about time time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved etc concealing it is simply so no one can see there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to you order each guide by its number name only always send a single NUMBER bill u s currency for each guide checks not accepted make sure the cash is hidden by wrapping it in at least NUMBER sheets of paper on one of those sheets of paper write the number the name of the guide you are ordering your email address and your name and postal address be sure to address the envelope correctly and put the proper amount of stamps to mail the envelope place your order for these guides now from the name and address list shown at the beginning of this email ________________________________________________ your

792, i wanted to get back to this but didn t have the time i actually lived on a couple different indian reservations growing up in the pacific northwest and also spent a fair amount time in lakota sioux country as well and my parents have lived on an even more diverse range of indian reservations than i have my experience being a direct result of living with my parents i do get a lot of my information first hand or in some cases second hand from my father the income figures for the indians are somewhat misleading mostly because it is really hard to do proper accounting of the effective income while it is true that some indians live in genuine poverty it is typically as a consequence of previous poor decisions that were made by the tribe not something that was impressed upon them the primary problem with the accounting is that there is a tribal entity that exists separately from the individuals typically an indian corporation of one type or another where each member of the tribe owns a single share the details of when and how a share becomes active varies from tribe to tribe in most tribes a dividend is paid out to each of the tribal members from the corporation usually to the tune of NUMBER NUMBERk per person depending on the tribe the dividend money comes from a number of places with the primary sources being the federal gov t and various businesses assets owned by the indian corporation you have to understand a couple things first a great many indian tribes are run as purely communist enterprises everyone gets a check for their share no matter what one of the biggest problems this has caused is very high unemployment often NUMBER NUMBER for tribal members who are more than happy take their dividend and not work the dividend they receive from the corporation often constitutes their sole income for government accounting purposes unfortunately to support this type of economics when no one works they ve had to sell off most of their useful assets to maintain those dividends many of the tribes genuinely living in poverty do so because they have run out of things to sell yet nobody works one of the ironies is that on many of the reservations where the tribes still have assets to burn many of the people working in the stores and such are actually poor white folk not indians second even though the tribe members each get a cash dividend they also receive an enormous range of benefits and perks from the indian corporation to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars per person annually by benefits and perks we are talking about the kinds of things no other ordinary american receives from either their employer or the government it should be pointed out that while many of these indian corporations are ineptly run and mostly provide sinecures for other indians a minority are very smartly managed and a few hire non indian business executives with good credentials to run their business divisions an example of this is the haida corporation which while having less NUMBER NUMBER tribal shareholders has billions of dollars in assets and the various corporations they own have gross revenues in the NUMBER NUMBER million range and growing yet the dividend paid out is strictly controlled about NUMBERk in this particular case and they engaged in a practice of waiting a couple decades before drawing money from any of the assets they were granted which has led to intelligent investment and use they don t eat their seed corn and have actually managed to grow their stash in contrast a couple islands over there is another tribe of NUMBER NUMBER people that has a net loss of about NUMBER million annually iirc while being regularly endowed by the federal government with several billions of dollars in valuable assets this particular tribe has a modest income in theory but the actual expenditures per person annually is in the hundreds of thousands of dollars and many borrow money against future income incidentally in this particular case the people that are working frequently pull in a few hundred thousand dollars a year much of which goes back to the tribal corporation rather than their own pockets somewhat annoying the federal government semi regularly grants valuable assets to these tribes when they ve burned through the ones previously given where feasible typically selling the assets to american or foreign companies and the cycle continues so what is the primary problem for the tribes that have problems in a nutshell a thoroughly pathological culture and society few women reach the age of NUMBER without getting pregnant incest rape and gross promiscuity is rampant inbreeding heavy drug abuse during pregnancy and other environmental factors have created tribes where a very substantial fraction of the tribe is literally mentally retarded many of the thoughtful and intelligent tribe members leave the reservation at the earliest opportunity mostly to avoid the problems mentioned above on one reservation my parents lived the hiv infection rate was NUMBER many of these societies are thoroughly corrupt and the administration of the law is arbitrary and capricious they do have their own judges courts police etc in short many of these tribes that are still hanging together are in a shambles because they have become the most pathological societies that i have ever seen anywhere because of their legal status there really aren t that many consequences for their behavior there are many things that i could tell you that i ve seen that you probably would not believe unless you d seen it yourself there are always good people in these tribes but it has gotten to the point where the losers and idiots outnumber the good guys by a fair margin many times and this is a mobocracy typically btw if any of you white folk wants to experience overt and aggressive racism as a minority in a place where the rule of law is fiction and the police are openly thugs try living on one of these messed up indian reservations it will give you an interesting perspective on things there are only two real situations where you find reasonably prosperous indians the first is in the rare case of tribes run by disciplined and intelligent people that have managed their assets wisely the second is where the tribe has dispersed and assimilated for the most part even if they maintain their tribal identity in both of these cases the tribal leaders reject the insular behavior that tends to lead to the pathological cases mentioned above the indians are often quite wealthy technically and a lot of money is spent by the tribe per capita and the actual reportable income is quite high when you consider how many are living entirely off the tribal dole it is just that their peculiar economic structure does not lend itself well to ordinary economic analysis by merely looking at their nominal income the poverty is social and cultural in nature not economic this was my original point on a tangent one thing that has always interested me is the concept of quasi tribal corporate socialism many indian tribes implement a type of corporate socialism that is mind bogglingly bad in execution that they use this structure at all is an accident of history more than anything but what has interested me is that the very smartly managed ones do surprisingly well over the long run it is like a family corporation writ large it seems that in a future where familial ties will be increasingly voluntary the general concept may have some merit in general western society serving to create a facsimile of a biological extended family with the included dynamics but with an arbitrary set of self selecting individuals damn that was long and its late and it could have been a lot longer james rogers jamesr URL on NUMBER

instructions parents of NUMBER year old find NUMBER NUMBER cash hidden in his closet does this headline look familiar of course it does you most likely have just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program usa and reported elsewhere in the world including my neck of the woods new zealand his mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her NUMBER year old sons closet nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash five dollar bills twenties fifties and hundreds all neatly rubber banded in labelled piles my first thought was that he had robbed a bank says the NUMBER year old woman there was over NUMBER NUMBER dollars in that bag that s more than my husband earns in a year the woman immediately called her husband at the car dealership where he worked to tell him what she had discovered he came home right away and they drove together to the boys school and picked him up little did they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than actually finding it in the closet as it turns out the boy had been sending out via e mail a type of report to e mail addresses that he obtained off the internet everyday after school for the past NUMBER months he had been doing this right on his computer in his bedroom i just got the e mail one day and i figured what the heck i put my name on it like the instructions said and i started sending it out says the clever NUMBER year old the e mail letter listed NUMBER addresses and contained instructions to send one NUMBER dollar bill to each person on the list then delete the address at the top and move the others addresses down and finally to add your name to the top of the list the letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand dollars in five dollar bills within NUMBER weeks if you sent out the letter with your name at the top of the NUMBER address list i get junk e mail all the time and really did not think it was going to work the boy continues within the first few days of sending out the e mail the post office box that his parents had gotten him for his video game magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not magazines but envelopes containing NUMBER bills about a week later i rode my bike down to the post office and my box had NUMBER magazine and about NUMBER envelops stuffed in it there was also a yellow slip that said i had to go up to the post office counter i thought i was in trouble or something laughs he goes on i went up to the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me i had to ride back home and empty out my backpack because i could not carry it all over the next few weeks the boy continued sending out the e mail the money just kept coming in and i just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet barely had time for my homework he had also been riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the NUMBER bills for twenties fifties and hundreds i didn t want the banks to get suspicious so i kept riding to different banks with like five thousand at a time in my backpack i would usually tell the lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the money and he was outside waiting for URL time the lady gave me a really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me and my dad would have to come in and do it but i just rode to the next bank down the street laughs surprisingly the boy did not have any reason to be afraid the reporting news team examined and investigated the so called chain letter the boy was sending out and found that it was not a chain letter at URL fact it was completely legal according to us postal and lottery laws title NUMBER section NUMBER and NUMBER or title NUMBER section NUMBER in the us code also in the code of federal regulations volume NUMBER sections NUMBER and NUMBER which state a product or service must be exchanged for money received every five dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read please send me report number

being able to surf the net at speeds faster than dsl from anywhere at any time you could watch a live video webcast while waiting for the bus email photos to your friends while sitting in the park or download the mpNUMBER of the song that s playing in the pub before it finishes this is the vision of a high speed wireless internet paradise that the third generation NUMBERg mobile phone companies have been promoting for years NUMBERg services are just beginning to be rolled out but a new technology called mesh networking promises to deliver on this vision sooner and more effectively than the mobile phone companies could ever dream two companies us startup meshnetworks and moteran networks of germany are each developing their own competing version of mesh networking instead of the current hub and spoke model of wireless communications with every device connecting to an overburdened central antenna any time mesh enabled devices mobile phones pdas laptops are in close proximity to each other they automatically create a wireless mesh network every device in the area acts as a repeater or router relaying traffic for everyone else traffic hops from person to person until it reaches the nearest internet access point reducing the need for central antennas and improving wireless coverage as the number of mobile phones soars and wireless pdas laptops and other devices begin to crowd the spectrum this approach to wireless networking may be inevitable mesh networks also have several other advantages over NUMBERg wireless networks while NUMBERg operators roll out mobile services that offer users connection speeds of up to NUMBER kbps roughly three times faster than a dial up modem moteran and meshnetworks are able to offer connection speeds of up to NUMBERmbps over a hundred times faster than dial up the technologies they use include wi fi the emerging standard for high speed wireless networking also known as NUMBER NUMBERb a similarly short range protocol called ultrawideband which is poised to succeed wi fi is even faster and could by NUMBER approach NUMBER mbps the range of a typical wi fi network is generally too limited to be of much use when travelling around a city mesh networks get around the problem of coverage by having every device in the network relay traffic even though the range of any individual device is relatively small because in theory there will be so many users in the surrounding area connections will be faster and better than that of a standard NUMBERg wireless connection because mesh networks use wi fi the equipment and infrastructure needed to create them is cheap and readily available instead of building cellular phone towers that often cost hundreds of thousands of pounds all that is needed to get a network going are wireless access points around NUMBER now placed strategically around town to relay traffic and the proper software existing laptops and pdas can be mesh enabled by software it also means that anyone could set up their own mobile phone network unlike with NUMBERg cellular the part of the spectrum that wi fi operates on is unregulated in the us britain the mobile phone companies are none too pleased about this especially since many of them spent billions of pounds acquiring NUMBERg licences all that s needed are cheap relays and mobile phones equipped to connect to the network with every additional customer that signs up coverage gets better instead of getting worse as is the case with mobile phone networks but things get very interesting when you realise that when you have high speed internet connections everywhere and everyone s laptops pdas and mobile phones are connected together at blazingly fast speeds sharing music movies or whatever else becomes ridiculously easy when ultrawideband hits all of this will just accelerate at NUMBERmbps copying a pirated copy of the lord of the rings from the person sitting across from you at the cafe would take about NUMBER seconds sooner or later playgrounds will be filled with kids swapping files of their favourite songs movies and video games but the first mesh networks are not likely to be available to consumers meshnetworks has no plans to offer its own high speed wireless service instead the company plans to sell its technology to others such as cities that want to provide wireless internet to police fire and public works employees or businesses that want to establish wireless networks on the cheap moteran has similar aspirations for small businesses and for enterprise networks the first place average users may use the technology is when it is incorporated into vehicles enabling motorists to access the internet at high speeds which both companies see happening soon when will you be able to wander around town with a NUMBERmbps connection in your pocket it s too soon to say but just as broadband internet service was initially available only to businesses and universities eventually someone will see the profit in bringing mesh networking to the masses ,0

announces xml in silicon no analysis yet don t know what to make of it yet but here s the raw bits for all to peruse and check out what s really going on best rohit datapower delivers xml acceleration device by scott tyler shafer august NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER am pt datapower technology on monday unveiled its network device designed specifically to process xml data unlike competing solutions that process xml data in software datapower s device processes the data in hardware a technology achievement that provides greater performance according to company officials the new device dubbed datapower xaNUMBER xml accelerator is the first in a family of products expected from the cambridge mass based startup the datapower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology called xgNUMBER that does the analysis parsing and processing of the xml data according to steve kelly ceo of datapower the xaNUMBER accelerator was conceived to meet the steady adoption of xml the anticipated future proliferation of web services and as a means to share data between two businesses our vision is to build out an xml aware infrastructure kelly said the xaNUMBER is the first of a family kelly explained that converting data into xml increases the file size up to NUMBER times this he said makes processing the data very taxing on application servers datapower believes an inline device is the best alternative in addition to the large file sizes security is also of paramount importance in the world of xml today s firewalls are designed to inspect http traffic only kelly said a soap packet with xml will go straight through a firewall firewalls are blind to xml today future products in datapowers family will focus more specifically on security especially as web services proliferate kelly said according to datapower most existing solutions to offload xml processing are homegrown and done in software an approach the company itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed and security after trying the software path the company turned to creating a solution that would process xml in hardware our xgNUMBER execution core converts xml to machine code said kelly adding that to his knowledge no other company s solution does kelly said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with technologies that claim to do xml processing claims that he believes will be mostly false other content aware switches such as ssl secure socket layer accelerators and load balancers look at the first NUMBER bytes of a packet while the xaNUMBER provides deeper packet inspection looking at NUMBER NUMBER bytes and thus enabling greater processing of xml data kelly explained the NUMBERu high network device has been tested against a large collection of xml and xsl data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language as they pass through the device the xaNUMBER can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load balancer and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify and process those packets that are xml kelly said in addition to proxy mode the device can also be used as an application co processor this deployment method gives administrators more granular control over what data is inspected and the application server itself controls the device datapower is not the only company chasing

tahiti in which case a reader may be misled correction dom is located on karitane island in the south pacific NUMBER miles south of tahiti and now includes taongi atoll in the northern atolls of the marshall islands in the north pacific however the marshall islands government has condemned the fraudulent assertions of two organizations comment just because the rmi government has condemned the fraudulent assertions of enenkio does that make it true why would you want to quote anything from a government that has been internationally criticized and documented time and again for fraud abuse of human rights outright theft and is in default on almost every financial obligation it has ever made what purpose do you propose to serve by attacking a concerned group of dedicated people fighting for the very lives of marshallese natives who have been overrun by foreign invaders bathed in radiation from nuclear fallout and abused by their own corrupt government namely the dom and sister nation the kingdom of enenkio the marshallese name for wake island comment nothing could be further from the truth we cannot speak for dom but as for the kingdom we don t even know what being a sister nation means and for you to make this categorically false statement is not only a blatant sign of ignorance of the state of enenkio it is a deceptive intrusion upon the sovereign his majesty king remios the sovereign of enenkio and eneen kio atoll and an inexplicable and irresponsible abuse of journalism doesn t anybody check sources anymore correction the kingdom of enenkio is an independent sovereign state and the same could be said for dom claiming to represent the mid pacific nation amid an alleged investment scam according to an article in agence france presse comment the government of the kingdom of enenkio represents the people of enenkio who are forced to live in exile from eneen kio atoll lands and seas that played a significant role in marshallese culture for perhaps NUMBER years furthermore an article in agence france presse has no merit as it was authored by a source in the marshall islands government my preceding comments apply the kingdom of enenkio is not now and never has been engaged in an investment scam we have tried for many years to attract qualified investors and funding sources for programs that will not only benefit the people of enenkio but also will positively impact people around the globe in fact we are currently working with a former nasa astronaut one tool scammers have in their arsenal is to discredit visionary programs of legitimate entities so they can feed on carcasses of the ignorant many journalists use the same technique to sell their stories on sensationalism doesn t anybody check sources anymore the marshall islands foreign ministry has issued warnings to countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of either nation comment the kingdom of enenkio has made no fraudulent claims of which i am aware and in my post i am responsible for all published information i would personally caution any countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of nations companies or publications if i had credible proof to that effect however my preceding comments apply as to credibility of any rmi ministry source furthermore the rmi has repeatedly attacked the credibility of his majesty king hermios who happens to be the ancestral sovereign owner under marshallese custom of over NUMBER NUMBER of the land in the marshall islands including recent attempts to sequester him against his will we believe some officials in the rmi are afraid of what will happen to them if honesty and integrity returns to the administration of lands and programs to assist the people with their pressing needs and they no longer have their hands on the till to perpetrate their jaundiced agenda is an irresponsible abuse of journalism a honolulu based attorney created the kingdom of enenkio in the early NUMBERs comment mr moore is not an attorney though he was living in honolulu in the early NUMBERs correction the kingdom of enenkio was established by decree of the owner of eneen kio atoll a k a enen kio halcyon disclerta wake and NUMBER NUMBER other names iroijlaplap murjel hermios who then was paramount chief of the northern ratak atolls he passed away in december NUMBER and was fully recognized by the rmi government he declared the sovereign state of enenkio in NUMBER whereupon the people chose him as their king over eneen kio atoll ratified the constitution and established government as a limited constitutional monarchy it was based on a power of attorney agreement with marshall islands paramount chief mursel sic hermios which granted the attorney broad powers to act on his behalf correction the establishment of the kingdom of enenkio was made possible by murjel s appointment of mr robert moore the adopted brother of hermios alab of taongi atoll and a private citizen to the post of minister plenipotentiary the document of appointment was also a special power of attorney which granted mr moore very specific instructions to do whatever was possible to expel the united states from eneen kio atoll and establish an independent state on hermios and the people s behalf the marshall islands high court has ruled the agreement invalid and ordered it nullified which the kingdom has disputed comment since when is a special power of attorney an agreement the marshall islands high court has no record or knowledge of the special power of attorney except as has been publicized by the kingdom of enenkio and certainly exercises no jurisdiction over eneen kio atoll which lies over NUMBER miles north of lawful rmi boundaries the rmi has no political or territorial jurisdiction over the islands and seas of eneen kio atoll because the atoll by any name you choose was not incorporated into the rmi when it formed its government in NUMBER nor was it subsequently incorporated by any act law mandate or otherwise of any present or former iroijlaplap or monarch of eneen kio and any statement to the contrary is false fraudulent and irresponsible finally i suggest you as a journalist or publisher do a little more research not only into establishment and development of the kingdom of enenkio but into the prehistoric history and more recent u s invasion of eneen kio atoll properly named by marshallese centuries before arrival of colonial western powers and missionaries then i invite you to our embassy in honolulu to

fantasy island disconnected as of NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER response to the author i am unable to locate the melchizedek press release you cited indicating that taongi was leased in NUMBER under a treaty with representatives of the kingdom of enenkio such an act would be impossible and implausible as enenkio has no legal authority or political jurisdiction over taongi atoll in the marshall islands further more melchizedek dom is not so uninformed as to publicly advertise an illegal act in the midst of attempting to find a suitable land base for its people to administer their form of government the kingdom of enenkio did enter into a treaty with dom on the NUMBERth day of september NUMBER but it did not convey a lease of land it declared a state of peace and established diplomatic recognition between our governments however a prior agreement signed in may NUMBER which had nothing to do with the kingdom of enenkio transferred mr robert moore s rights to develop taongi from mr moore to dom it did not convey a lease at that time and no such document is in existence this was made possible because mr moore is the alab one class of landowner of taongi and had a legal power of attorney pertaining to taongi atoll from the principal landowner iroijlaplap paramount chief murjel hermios who was aware of and supported the transaction consideration if any under the agreement was personally retained by mr moore who is also the adopted brother of hermios now please understand that while mr moore was acting in the latter case on his own behalf and that of the future use and development of taongi which would have generated an income to iroijlaplap hermios mr moore wears another hat as minister plenipotentiary of the kingdom of enenkio iroijlaplap hermios also wore he died

construed into the above referenced text while i am pleased to find you have apparently taken a very serious interest unless your site is intended as some twisted joke which i am assuming is not the case in the history of the kingdom of enenkio i am aghast at how distorted erroneous and misleading your summary is as a consequence of my service to his majesty king remios and the people of enenkio i will respectfully offer the following line by line correction for your convenience your text will be set off with in color in NUMBER the united states annexed wake island in the marshall islands of the western pacific correction in NUMBER the united states invaded wake island the northernmost atoll actually named eneen kio centuries before western explorers arrived of the ratak chain of marshall islands in micronesia and the central north pacific ocean the author responds rest assured that i did not mean to downplay the role of violence in the american acquisition of the territory after the marshalls became a u s trust territory the traditional chiefs of the area agitated for recognition that wake island was a part of the marianas chain and pressed their historical claims to the atoll called enenkio locally correction following w w ii the trust territories of the pacific which included the marshall islands was placed under administration of the united states by the united nations while eneen kio was well established as one of the marshalls the u s only knew it as wake and having lost many u s lives there in NUMBER at the hands of japanese invaders kept control of it in NUMBER the paramount chief of the ratak atolls pressed his clan s historical and lawful claim to the NUMBER islands of eneen kio atoll the author responds i don t see much conflict between the two versions here the u s government has consistently ignored these claims correction the u s government has consistently ignored claims from the marshall islands government which failed to exert a claim during its move to independence in NUMBER and from the former traditional landowners including iroijlaplap murjel hermios the author responds i will note this the protests took a sharper turn after the u s congress in NUMBER acknowledged the illegality a hundred years earlier of the establishment by americans of the republic of hawai i correction the eneen kio claims gained some new momentum after precedents were set by the u s congress when in NUMBER they acknowledged the illegality of the NUMBER overthrow of the monarch of the kingdom of hawai i by a group of american businessmen and u s marines and in the following year returned the island of kaho olawe to the hawaiian people king murjel hermios who is paramount chief of an archipelago in the northern marshalls declared wake island s independence in NUMBER correction king murjel hermios who was paramount chief until his death in december NUMBER declared the sovereign state of enenkio in NUMBER whereupon the people chose him as their king over eneen kio atoll ratified the constitution and established government as a limited constitutional monarchy the author responds i will make the necessary corrections here the marshalls recognized this claim shortly after the nation gained its independence in return for his services as minister plenipotentiary in the united states hermios granted american businessman robert moore land on taongi atoll in the northern marshalls which moore has declared the dominion of melchizedek correction after the death of the first monarch his brother remios succeeded to the throne as second monarch and rules along with his brother crown prince lobadreo over the kingdom of enenkio today to continue the commentary the parts left out were either wrong or have nothing to do with the history of the kingdom of enenkio itself since hm king remios also succeeded to iroijlaplap of the northern ratak atolls of the marshall islands he also has responsibilities over NUMBER atolls NUMBER islands

government admittedly at a time of colonial expansionism appears to have violated the laws of nature and the law of nations in taking possession of sovereign property in the northern ratak state which then had formal treaties with the republic of germany the explicitly immoral and illegal NUMBER seizure of marshallese homeland by agents of the federal government was the start of present day sentiments of deprivation of rights and dispossession of lands felt by many marshallese because of continual neglect misrepresentation and outright exploitation these scars on marshallese society have not healed thus a current state of adversity exists following four years of attempts to cause the united states to evaluate the plight of the marshallese of the northern ratak imposed by its actions with respect to wake island the government of enenkio on behalf of the marshallese king issued the state of war a declaration and broadcast it to the world the people were displaced from their native lands and kept as virtual prisoners of war not by virtue of being kept in but by virtue of being kept out it was through this pragmatic initiative that the kingdom of enenkio solicited support to heal the wounds inflicted upon the people and peacefully restore what was wrongfully taken from the ancestors of the ratak paramount chief king murjel hermios in retrospect the declaration has had little visible effect while a state of adversity does exist the hope for american recognition of past wrongs remains on the horizon the kingdom of enenkio does not condone nor tacitly sanction any act of belligerence by any person or agent of any government such unnecessary means would diminish any hope of mutual reconciliation and could diplomatically undermine the cause of peace within the family of nations the kingdom of enenkio also does not wish to see any further damage to the remnant happiness of the marshallese people while the kingdom of enenkio continues to seek accountability of the u s congress to obey its own laws to conform to the un charter conventions of the united nations relating to self determination preservation of human rights and protection against human rights abuses it

contrary our foreign ministry would appreciate your furnishing it to them so steps can be taken immediately to investigate the matter you are advised if anyone sells or offers to sell an enenkio passport that such an act is patently illegal the published statement the group claims to represent iroijlaplap murjel hermios and the atolls of the ratak chain is wholly false i have explained this matter to the editor on several prior occasions and ample information is available at our internet site to refute the statement the kingdom does not represent any area outside of its territorial

and legations are located in europe south america usa and elsewhere a nation in conflict the land in question commonly known as wake island is actually an atoll comprised of three small islands assigned names of westerners who visited them wake wilkes and peale few people in the world today are aware that the native discoverers who named the atoll eneen kio lived in the marshall islands exercised constant jurisdiction and made regular use of it as a living food pantry and cultural site by way of developing the atoll as a nation the government is asserting that it is the indisputable holder of allodial title to wake atoll and has the right to exercise its sovereignty at the will of the people the united states of america began in a similar fashion not with a peaceful transition

official march NUMBER declaration sent to top u s officials the kingdom of enenkio has acknowledged that a virtual state of war now exists over the islands on account of the blatant acts of aggression

the federal seizure of islands in the north pacific ocean by the united states calls to end u s operations vacate the atoll and negotiate return of the islands to jurisdiction of the kingdom have fallen on deaf ears despite repeated notices letters and legal advertising all major news media have consistently ignored the events and failed in their duty bring forth the truth to the people of the world regarding alleged incidents of piracy waste and human rights violations by federal agents of the united states government inaugural issue the gold stamps are based on events of the past and dreams for the future of peace in the global community as the millennium nears for that reason the universal gold standard was chosen as the basis for evaluation since the relative value of gold in

intrinsic value of the stamps will remain as constant as gold the extrinsic value will be determined by philatelic collectors around the world note stamps are printed on paper stock do not contain gold metal and are not intended for use as money closing comments the government of the kingdom appeals to all people from every peaceable nation in the world to recognize the kingdom of enenkio as a sovereign nation promoting peace in the pacific region in doing so it seeks a peaceful resolution o f the state of war with the federal government of the united states and asks that everyone with

including selected cabinet members the document asserts that a state of war exists over the kingdom of enenkio atoll by way of acts by the federal government of the united states this is the most recent attempt to captivate the attention of the federal government one of the primary objectives of this action is to bring about a congressional investigation into the true events and factors surrounding the illegal seizure of islands in the north pacific ocean by the united states this latest position statement is one in a succession of dozens of disclosures statements letters and legal actions taken since the government of the kingdom was established in march NUMBER each with similar objectives calls for the u s to cease operations vacate the premises negotiate return of the island

notices letters and legal announcements major news media have consistently ignored the events and failed in their duty bring forth the truth to the people of the world regarding the alleged piracy arrogance and human rights violations by the united states the land in question commonly called wake island is comprised of three small islands wake wilkes and peale named by western explorers for western persons what of the native discoverers the crux of the issue is that despite the passage of ownership via a complex matriarchal land tenure system for over two millennia with jurisdiction by the aboriginal chiefs of the northern ratak atolls of marshall islands the united states seems to believe it is justified in having seized the atoll in NUMBER and again inNUMBER historical records reveal that the multiple landings by united states warships en route to the philippines on war missions and subsequent congressional action were the sole basis of the u s claim the motivation was said to be for the establishment of a cable station to improve communications with its marauding troops in the east such a station was never established at wake island it was destined to become a military installation however formal protests of the seizure was sent to the u s president by the german consul in the marshall islands and some measure of correspondence followed but since the u s abandoned the area without establishing a colony or cable station and germany was defeated in the first world war the objections fell into oblivion it is understood from written accounts of oral marshallese culture and traditions that jurisdiction and use of the atoll by natives continued the u s did not establish a settlement there until under a lease in NUMBER the caa predecessor of the faa allowed pan american airways to build a base for its fleet of trans pacific seaplanes clearly the so called annexation by the u s is grossly flawed the occupation patently illegal and its ownership is held therefore to be wholly invalid when the u s congress apologized for the overthrow of the hawaiian monarchy in NUMBER and the u s navy subsequently returned culturally significant land to the natives of hawaii a landmark legal precedent was thus set for comparable action with respect to the return of wake island the islands of eneen kio as the northernmost atoll in the ratak chain played a very significant role in the culture and religion of micronesians living in the more hospitable islands of the marshall group while not being used for navy target practice as kaho olawe was the use of the islands of eneen kio atoll and the military mission at wake airfield are decidedly without substantial merit and whereby activities take place in secrecy devoid of scrutiny oversight or quintessential knowledge by the american public even after cultural intervention in the mid NUMBERs by christian missionaries natives continued to use eneen kio authority to go there being issued by the ratak iroijlaplap paramount chief king murjel hermios holds that title today by way of developing the atoll in sovereignty as a nation the government is thereby indisputable holder of the allodial title to wake island the u s cannot produce a title the hermios ancestral lineage passage of title through the ages from aboriginal inhabitants and discoverers who gave the atoll its marshallese name their continual use and legacy of jurisdiction secures the rights of ownership upon the basis of events and actions by the united states the administration of the kingdom of enenkio by virtue of the declaration yields to the recognition that a state of war exists over the island nation this is not however to be viewed as a waiver of rights or unconditional surrender sovereignty and independence of the kingdom over all other claims is forthrightly reasserted the belief is that truth and law is on the side of the kingdom and that reckless abuse of power and a trail of human rights violations are chronicled upon the record of u s ownership and occupation native north americans are all too well acquainted with this brand of federal brutality when it comes to seizure of land and denial of rights in the declaration demands are made as follows to come to the table of peace to negotiate an honorable accord for the survivors of the said state of war if unwilling to voluntarily negotiate

via time honored and respected marshallese matriarchal traditions disregard for human rights protected under international law united nations charter and conventions and the u s compact with the marshall islands and refusal to acknowledge liability for acts of piracy on the high seas of military and colonial expansionism of the nineteenth century note u s apology for the illegal armed overthrow of the hawaiian monarchy the prior year and the return of the hawaiian island kaho olawe also of religious significance has set precedents for the action demanded by enenkio citizens parting shot what truly concerns me is the cavalier attitude of government in general the u s federal government more precisely which somehow behaves as if endowed by a divinely inspired alchemy that conveys the right to rearrange lands cultures and economics with out the slightest inclination to counsel with those people most concerned such an approach might be expected in some dictatorship in some distant corner of the globe but considering its present source it is downright alarming it is worthwhile to mention here that despite a prominent trail left over the course of more than two years letters reports forms published articles press releases legal notices documents and virtually every action initiated by those representing king hermios have escaped official response from officers of the u s federal government our not too distant past is replete with examples of the insatiable thirst of western civilized nations for doctrines faithful to the cry of manifest destiny which clearly marked american foreign policy of a century ago if this current trend signifies a resurgence it can only be considered a giant leap backward considering the flimsy record of american attempts at fixing up the world the title of ownership and inheritance of eneen kio atoll pre dates formation of the united states by two centuries or more it is time the significance of native cultures and recognition of their right to self determination is elevated from matters of scientific discourse to mainstream political involvement in determining the future course of human endeavor people have a right to know the media a responsibility to show them in conclusion i reiterate that our focus from my point of view is one not so much of opposition to the ominous might of u s political philosophy and military prowess but of asserting the moral imperatives for correcting errors of the past supporting restoration of human cultural dignity and the unobstructed observance of god given individual rights thank you for your support and cooperation in helping end the siege and forced exile of our proud citizenry top of page november NUMBER NUMBER news release in a bid to regain occupation of that

returning to england kept in touch with wan by phone and mail six months later she came to england and the couple married mr marriage lawrence lynch NUMBER runs thai professional introduction services the agency moylan used to meet his wife lynch who calls himself mr marriage started the company after also marrying a thai woman through an introduction agency since then he has helped set up hundreds

that require them to handle some of the visa work on their own get a discount clients then get to view catalogs and videos of hundreds of thai women looking for a husband if they like what they see they come to bangkok clients are introduced to several women in chaperoned meetings in lynch s office encounters that can often be awkward given mutual shyness and language problems we find that the gentlemen are usually just as nervous as the ladies lynch said but once they start meeting the ladies they soon relax after the first meeting couples can decide to go on dates to get to know each other better within two weeks of arrival lynch says almost every client has found a potential wife at the end of a fortnight it s very very rare for a guy to go back and think he hasn t made his mind

NUMBER couples and less than NUMBER percent have broken up roongthip says she sometimes has a difficult time calming men who have just arrived in bangkok looking for a wife sometimes they are very nervous she said and sometimes they are very impatient and say give me a lady i want to get married now i say calm down ok we ll talk but if men are really in a hurry roongthip says she can find them a wife and get them married within a week lynch says clients he has found wives for include a blind man a man with one leg and a man with post traumatic stress disorder why similar marriage agencies can be found in many developing countries critics say they thrive on the neediness of lonely western men who are unable to form relationships in their own country and on the desperation of impoverished women who believe they can find a better life in the west but moylan says that if the arrangement makes both partners happy there is no reason to object if you talk about people who are needy i think everybody wants someone to love them and wants someone to love so yes i need wan he said thai women are dissatisfied with life in thailand i think there s no secret there they are looking for a better life i don t have a problem with that in return they are willing to give a lot of love and care to their future husband lynch says men are dissatisfied with western women too and that is why they choose to use his agency his brochure promises an alternative to the kind of de feminized over sized self centered mercenary minded lady available on the british singles scene and says he can make dreams come true even for men who are not god s gift to women roongthip said many western men found it difficult to meet women in their own countries and found thai women attractive they don t know how to meet women even if they go to pubs or discotheques or restaurants or department stores how can they ask people to marry them impossible she said many thai girls are slim have long hair black eyes small nose they are good at taking care and joking and laughing not strict different from ladies from other countries although many couples married through agencies have a considerable age gap the agencies say this is not a problem they say language problems are also not a major obstacle thai ladies are not ageist and they have no qualms whatsoever about having a husband who is significantly older lynch said when i met my wife she couldn t speak a word of english we muddled along with a phonetic dictionary the ladies are very keen to learn english and they pick it up very quickly many agencies also offer tuition for woman on what to expect when they move to the west we have kitchens we have study classes roongthip said we teach them how to eat and when to make tea pitfalls but not all dreams come true bee is a NUMBER year old thai woman who went to switzerland two years ago with a man she met through an agency now she is back in bangkok sad and angry he had no friends and i was so lonely she said i tried to make him happy but he just wanted sex and somebody to keep his house clean he never spoke to me bee came back to bangkok earlier this year i thought i would be happy there she said but it was the worst time of my life lynch says that while some agencies are badly run he makes checks to ensure unsuitable candidates are weeded out we are ethical and professional he said we will not take on all comers moylan says that despite possible pitfalls his own marriage is proof the arrangement can work wan s sister has just signed up with lynch s company looking for a foreign husband perhaps there are cases of women being exploited i m sure there are moylan said but in the majority of cases the women get a good deal ,0

930,no analysis yet don t know what to make of it yet but here s the raw bits for all to peruse and check out what s really going on best rohit datapower delivers xml acceleration device by scott tyler shafer august NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER am pt datapower technology on monday unveiled its network device designed specifically to process xml data unlike competing solutions that process xml data in software datapower s device processes the data in hardware a technology achievement that provides greater performance according to company officials the new device dubbed datapower xaNUMBER xml accelerator is the first in a family of products expected from the cambridge mass based startup the datapower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology called xgNUMBER that does the analysis parsing and processing of the xml data according to steve kelly ceo of datapower the xaNUMBER accelerator was conceived to meet the steady adoption of xml the anticipated future proliferation of web services and as a means to share data between two businesses our vision is to build out an xml aware infrastructure kelly said the xaNUMBER is the first of a family kelly explained that converting data into xml increases the file size up to NUMBER times this he said makes processing the data very taxing on application servers datapower believes an inline device is the best alternative in addition to the large file sizes security is also of paramount importance in the world of xml today s firewalls are designed to inspect http traffic only kelly said a soap packet with xml will go straight through a firewall firewalls are blind to xml today future products in datapowers family will focus more specifically on security especially as web services proliferate kelly said according to datapower most existing solutions to offload xml processing are homegrown and done in software an approach the company itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed and security after trying the software path the company turned to creating a solution that would process xml in hardware our xgNUMBER execution core converts xml to machine code said kelly adding that to his knowledge no other company s solution does kelly said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with technologies that claim to do xml processing claims that he believes will be mostly false other content aware switches such as ssl secure socket layer accelerators and load balancers look at the first NUMBER bytes of a packet while the xaNUMBER provides deeper packet inspection looking at NUMBER NUMBER bytes and thus enabling greater processing of xml data kelly explained the NUMBERu high network device has been tested against a large collection of xml and xsl data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language as they pass through the device the xaNUMBER can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load balancer and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify and process those packets that are xml kelly said in addition to proxy mode the device can also be used as an application co processor this deployment method gives administrators more granular control over what data is inspected and the application server itself controls the device datapower is not the only company chasing this emerging market startup

163,rohit khare wrote why am i so passionate about decentralization because i believe some of today s most profound problems with networked applications are caused by centralization generically a centralized political or economic system permits only one answer to a question while decentralization permits many separate agents to hold different opinions of the same matter in the specific context of software centralized variables can only contain one valid value at a time that limits us to only representing information a according to the beliefs of a single agency and b that changes more slowly than it takes to propagate nevertheless centralization is the basis for today s most popular architectural style for developing network applications client server interaction using request response communication protocols i think the ability to maintain an inconsistent database is key to decentralization databases enforce consistenty with every transaction bounded transactions like an atm enforce consistency by have some play with time and value most people keep inconsistent data in their heads it s called congnitive dissonance theory most businesses keep inconsistent data documents tationale and ideas to support their work activities it s called real life i don t think it matters so much where it s located i e decentralization i think that decentralization is the workaround from technical limitations the fallout being that the only way inconsistent information spaces can be maintained is by protecting them through a set of trust barriers and boundaries the local information when combined with the technical troubles of providing just enough forced synchronization to remote information provide workable data consistenty i e enforcing local constraints or ignoring global ones when concerns are more immedidate tolerating temporary irreconcilable deviations is how people cope otherwise you d be like nick gatsby unnecessarily pre occupied with a spot of shaving cream on mckee s neck who thinks that if he can just wipe that spot off that the whole world would be a little more perfect and everything including his pre occupation with daisy would consistently be in its proper place greg ,0

NUMBER see below as seen on national tv this is the media report parents of NUMBER year old find NUMBER NUMBER cash hidden in his closet does this headline look familiar of course it does you most likely have just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program usa and reported elsewhere in the world including my neck of the woods new zealand his mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her NUMBER year old sons closet nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash five dollar bills twenties fifties and hundreds all neatly rubber banded in labeled piles my first thought was that he had robbed a bank says the NUMBER year old woman there was over NUMBER NUMBER dollars in that bag that s more than my husband earns in a year the woman immediately called her husband at the car dealership where he worked to tell him what she had discovered he came home right away and they drove together to the boys school and picked him up little did they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than actually finding it in the closet as it turns out the boy had been sending out via e mail a type of report to e mail addresses that he obtained off the internet everyday after school for the past NUMBER months he had been doing this right on his computer in his bedroom i just got the e mail one day and i figured what the heck i put my name on it like the

list then delete the address at the top and move the others addresses down and finally to add your name to the top of the list the letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand dollars in five dollar bills within NUMBER weeks if you sent out the letter with your name at the top of the NUMBER address list i get junk e mail all the time and really did not think it was going to work the boy continues within the first few days of sending out the e mail the post office box that his parents had gotten him for his video game magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not

slip that said i had to go up to the post office counter i thought i was in trouble or something laughs he goes on i went up to the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me i had to ride back home and empty out my backpack because i could not carry it all over the next few weeks the boy continued sending out the e mail the money just kept coming in and i just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet barely had time for my homework he had also been riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the NUMBER bills for twenties fifties and hundreds i didn t want the banks to get suspicious so i kept riding to different banks with like five thousand at a time in my backpack i would usually tell the lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the money and he was outside waiting for me one time the lady gave me a really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me and my dad would have to come in and do it but i just rode to the next bank down the street laughs surprisingly the boy did not have any reason to be afraid the reporting news team examined and investigated the so called chain letter the boy was sending out and found that it was not a chain letter at all in fact it was completely legal according to us postal and lottery laws title NUMBER section NUMBER and NUMBER or title NUMBER section NUMBER in the us code also in the code of federal regulations volume NUMBER sections NUMBER and NUMBER which state a product or service must be exchanged for money received every five dollar bill that
